# Cheapest Cars to Maintain Long Term: Low-Cost Ownership Champions

Buying a car is one expense. Keeping it running is another. The difference in maintenance costs between the cheapest and most expensive cars to own is staggering: over 10 years, a Toyota Corolla will cost roughly $4,500 in maintenance while a BMW 7 Series will run $15,000+. That's a $10,000 gap that most buyers never consider at the dealership.

Here are the cars that cost the least to maintain over 5, 10, and 15+ years, with specific numbers and the reasoning behind why they're so cheap to keep running.

## What Makes a Car Cheap to Maintain

Before the list, it helps to understand the factors that drive maintenance costs:

1. **Parts availability and pricing.** High-volume cars have cheap parts because every auto parts store stocks them and multiple aftermarket manufacturers compete on price. A set of brake pads for a Corolla costs $25-$40. Brake pads for an Audi A4 cost $60-$100.

2. **Engineering simplicity.** Naturally aspirated engines with timing chains are cheaper to maintain than turbocharged engines with timing belts. Port injection is cheaper than direct injection (no carbon buildup). Conventional automatic transmissions are cheaper than dual-clutch or CVT units.

3. **Labor accessibility.** Some cars are designed so mechanics can access components easily. Others require removing half the engine bay to change spark plugs. Labor hours directly affect repair bills.

4. **Failure frequency.** The cheapest car to maintain is one that doesn't break. Cars with low failure rates save you the most money simply by not needing repairs.

## The Top 10 Cheapest Cars to Maintain Long Term

### 1. Toyota Corolla ($367/year average)

The benchmark for low maintenance costs. The Corolla uses timing chains (not belts) across all modern generations, parts are available everywhere, and the engines are essentially bulletproof with regular oil changes.

**10-year maintenance cost estimate:** $4,000-$5,000
**Notable:** The Corolla Hybrid (2020+) is even cheaper to maintain because regenerative braking means brake pads last 80,000-100,000+ miles.

### 2. Toyota Camry ($388/year average)

Same philosophy as the Corolla in a midsize package. The 2.5L 2AR-FE/A25A-FKS engines are among the most reliable in production. The V6 (2GR-FKS) is equally durable and doesn't cost significantly more to maintain.

**10-year maintenance cost estimate:** $4,200-$5,500
**Notable:** Camry Hybrid models have even lower costs. The hybrid battery is warranted for 10 years/150,000 miles and rarely fails even after that.

### 3. Honda Civic ($368/year average)

Nearly tied with the Corolla. The Civic's main advantage is that Honda engines run exceptionally clean, meaning catalytic converters, oxygen sensors, and emissions components last longer than average. The main additional maintenance item is a valve adjustment every 100,000 miles ($200-$300), which is unique to Honda but cheap.

**10-year maintenance cost estimate:** $4,000-$5,200
**Watch out for:** The 2006-2008 engine block cracking issue. Stick to 2009+ models for worry-free ownership.

### 4. Toyota Prius ($405/year average)

The Prius is the secret weapon of low-cost ownership. The hybrid system means the gas engine works less (extending its life), the regenerative braking means brake pads last 100,000+ miles, and the Atkinson-cycle engine is one of the most thermally efficient designs ever mass-produced.

**10-year maintenance cost estimate:** $4,500-$5,500
**Hybrid battery concern:** The Generation 3 Prius (2010-2015) hybrid battery typically lasts 150,000-200,000 miles. Replacement from Toyota costs $2,800-$3,500, but aftermarket/refurbished options run $1,200-$1,800. Even factoring in one battery replacement, the Prius is cheaper to own than most gas-only cars over 200,000 miles.

### 5. Mazda3 ($433/year average)

Mazda is the most underrated value in long-term maintenance costs. The SkyActiv engines are naturally aspirated with timing chains, and Mazda's parts pricing is competitive with Toyota and Honda. The SkyActiv 6-speed automatic is a conventional torque converter unit (not a CVT or dual-clutch), which is inherently more durable and cheaper to service.

**10-year maintenance cost estimate:** $4,800-$6,000
**Notable:** Mazda's rust-proofing has improved dramatically since 2014. Earlier Mazdas (especially the Mazda3 2004-2009) were notorious for rust in northern climates.

### 6. Honda CR-V ($407/year average)

The 2015-2016 CR-V with the 2.4L K24W engine is the cheapest CR-V to maintain (no turbo, timing chain, simple design). The 2017+ CR-V with the 1.5L turbo is still affordable to maintain, but adds turbo-related potential costs and requires premium-priced spark plugs.

**10-year maintenance cost estimate:** $4,500-$5,800
**Best maintenance year:** 2015-2016. The naturally aspirated 2.4L has no turbo to fail, no carbon buildup from direct injection, and parts are everywhere.

### 7. Toyota RAV4 ($429/year average)

Essentially a lifted Camry in terms of powertrain, so maintenance costs are similar. The RAV4 Hybrid adds AWD with virtually no additional maintenance requirements (the rear motor is sealed and maintenance-free).

**10-year maintenance cost estimate:** $4,700-$6,000
**RAV4 Hybrid advantage:** No traditional AWD system to service (no rear differential fluid changes, no transfer case). This saves $200-$400 over 100,000 miles compared to mechanical AWD systems.

### 8. Hyundai Elantra ($452/year average)

Hyundai has improved dramatically in reliability and maintenance costs. The 2017+ Elantra with the 2.0L Atkinson-cycle engine is a simple, efficient, and cheap-to-maintain car. Parts are affordable and increasingly available at all major auto parts stores.

**10-year maintenance cost estimate:** $5,000-$6,500
**Avoid:** The 2011-2016 Elantra with the 1.8L Nu engine, which had higher oil consumption rates. The 2017+ 2.0L is a different and better engine.

### 9. Kia Forte ($451/year average)

Shares the same platform and engines as the Hyundai Elantra, so maintenance costs are nearly identical. The Forte often costs slightly less to purchase, making its total cost of ownership even lower.

**10-year maintenance cost estimate:** $5,000-$6,500
**Best value:** 2019+ Forte GT with the 1.6T. More power than the base engine with only marginally higher maintenance costs (turbo notwithstanding, the 1.6T has been reliable).

### 10. Nissan Versa ($456/year average, with a major caveat)

The Versa is one of the cheapest cars to perform basic maintenance on. Oil changes, brakes, and routine items are extremely affordable. However, the CVT transmission is the elephant in the room.

**The CVT problem:** Nissan's JATCO CVTs in the 2012-2019 Versa have a high failure rate. A CVT replacement costs $3,500-$4,500, which on a car worth $6,000-$8,000 can be a death sentence. The 2020+ Versa uses an improved CVT that appears to be more reliable, but the data is still young.

**Recommendation:** Only buy a 2020+ Versa, or a pre-2012 Versa with the conventional 4-speed automatic if you can find one.

## Cars That Seem Cheap but Aren't

### Volkswagen Jetta ($600/year average)

The Jetta looks like a bargain at purchase, but VW parts cost 30-50% more than comparable Toyota/Honda parts, and the DSG dual-clutch transmission requires a $400-$500 fluid change every 40,000 miles. The EA888 2.0T (2018+) also needs intake valve cleaning every 60,000-80,000 miles ($400-$600) due to direct injection carbon buildup.

### Subaru Impreza/Crosstrek ($617/year average)

AWD adds maintenance complexity (differential fluid, CV axles), and Subaru's boxer engine design makes some repairs more labor-intensive (spark plug replacement on a boxer requires more disassembly than an inline-four). The head gasket issue on older models (pre-2012) can be a $2,000+ surprise.

### Mini Cooper ($846/year average)

Minis look affordable and fun, but they're essentially BMWs underneath. The N14 and N18 turbocharged engines have well-documented timing chain, thermostat, and water pump failures. Parts are expensive, and many repairs require specialized tools. The "cute" factor wears off fast when you see the maintenance bills.

## The Formula for Minimum Maintenance Cost

If you're optimizing purely for the lowest possible maintenance cost over 10+ years:

1. **Buy a Toyota or Honda** with a naturally aspirated engine and timing chain
2. **Avoid turbochargers** (they add cost even when they don't fail)
3. **Avoid CVT transmissions** (particularly Nissan's)
4. **Choose the most popular trim level** (most parts availability)
5. **Consider a hybrid** (regenerative braking alone saves hundreds in brake costs)
6. **Do your own basic maintenance** (oil changes, air filters, and cabin filters are simple DIY jobs that save $50-$100 each time)

The absolute cheapest car to maintain over 10 years in 2026 is a **Toyota Corolla Hybrid** or **Toyota Prius**. The combination of Toyota reliability, hybrid efficiency, and regenerative braking creates an ownership cost floor that nothing else matches.

## Maintenance Cost by Category

To put these numbers in broader context:

| Category | Average Annual Cost | Examples |
|----------|-------------------|----------|
| Japanese Compact | $370-$450 | Corolla, Civic, Mazda3 |
| Japanese Midsize | $390-$470 | Camry, Accord, Mazda6 |
| Japanese Crossover | $410-$500 | CR-V, RAV4, CX-5 |
| Korean Compact | $450-$520 | Elantra, Forte, Mazda3 |
| American Midsize | $520-$650 | Malibu, Fusion, Camry |
| German Compact | $600-$850 | Jetta, 3 Series, A4 |
| German Luxury | $900-$1,400 | 5 Series, E-Class, A6 |
| British Luxury | $1,200-$1,800 | Range Rover, Jaguar |

## The Bottom Line

The cheapest cars to maintain are boring, popular, and Japanese. That's not a coincidence. High production volume means cheap parts. Conservative engineering means fewer failures. And decades of refinement mean the maintenance procedures are well-understood by every mechanic in the country.

If low maintenance cost is your top priority, buy a Toyota Corolla, Toyota Camry, Honda Civic, or Toyota Prius and follow the factory maintenance schedule. You'll spend less on maintenance in 10 years than most luxury car owners spend in 3.
