# How Long Does a Mazda CX-5 Last?

A well-maintained Mazda CX-5 will typically last 200,000 to 250,000 miles. That puts it behind the Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V in raw longevity, but ahead of most other compact SUVs. The Skyactiv platform has been in production since 2012, and by now there's enough real-world data to know exactly what holds up and what doesn't.

## Generation Breakdown

### 2nd Generation (2017-2024): The One to Buy

**Engine:** Skyactiv-G 2.5L (187 hp), available 2.5L turbo (227 hp, 2019+)
**Transmission:** Skyactiv-Drive 6-speed automatic
**Expected lifespan:** 200,000-260,000 miles

The 2017 redesign addressed most of the first generation's weak points. Better sound insulation, improved interior materials, and a more refined 2.5L engine. The 6-speed automatic is a conventional torque converter unit (not a CVT), which is inherently more durable and easier to service.

**NHTSA complaint data tells the story:**
- 2017: 579 complaints (typical for a first model year of a new generation)
- 2018: 360 complaints
- 2019: 291 complaints
- 2020: 207 complaints

That's a steady decline, showing Mazda resolved early issues quickly.

**The naturally aspirated 2.5L** is the reliability pick. It uses a 13:1 compression ratio, timing chain, and (starting in 2019 on the turbo, all models by later years) a combination of port and direct injection. The high compression design extracts efficiency without turbo complexity.

**The 2.5L turbo** (available from 2019) adds a turbocharger to the same base engine. Early data is positive, but turbochargers are inherently additional complexity with a finite lifespan. Expect turbo replacement around 150,000-200,000 miles ($1,200-$2,000). If maximum longevity is your priority, the naturally aspirated version is the safer bet.

**Known problems in this generation:**
- Infotainment screen delamination on 2017-2018 models (touch screen becomes unresponsive or develops dark spots). Mazda extended warranty coverage for this. Replacement cost otherwise: $800-$1,200
- Windshield cracking from minor impacts. This is a common owner complaint across multiple model years; the glass seems unusually thin
- Liftgate struts weaken around 60,000-80,000 miles ($150-$250 to replace both)
- Some 2017-2018 owners report excessive brake dust and squealing. This is a pad compound issue, not a defect. Switching to ceramic pads ($80-$120) resolves it

### 1st Generation (2013-2016): Solid but Watch for Rust

**Engine:** Skyactiv-G 2.0L (155 hp) or 2.5L (184 hp)
**Transmission:** Skyactiv-Drive 6-speed automatic or 6-speed manual (rare)
**Expected lifespan:** 180,000-220,000 miles

The first-gen CX-5 introduced the Skyactiv platform, and it was good from the start. The 2.5L engine is the one to target; the 2.0L is adequate but feels underpowered for an SUV, especially at highway speeds or with passengers.

**The rust issue is documented.** NHTSA has complaints about premature corrosion on 2013-2016 CX-5s, particularly on the rear subframe, rear wheel arches, and lower door panels. This is most severe in salt-belt states. If you're buying a first-gen CX-5 in the Northeast or Midwest, put it on a lift and inspect the subframe carefully. Perforation rust in the subframe is a safety issue and a likely deal-breaker.

**NHTSA data:**
- 2013: 746 complaints (first model year, higher volume is normal)
- 2014: 458 complaints
- 2015: 373 complaints
- 2016: 552 complaints (uptick due to LED headlight issues and some engine stalling reports)

**Known problems:**
- Engine stalling at low speeds on some 2014-2016 models. Mazda issued TSB 01-036/16 addressing fuel system software updates
- LED headlight condensation on 2016 models ($0 if under warranty, $400-$700 otherwise)
- Rear differential mount bushing wear around 80,000-100,000 miles on AWD models ($200-$400)

## Engine Deep Dive: Skyactiv-G 2.5L

The Skyactiv-G 2.5L (PE-VPS) is the heart of the CX-5 across both generations. Here's what actually breaks and when:

**Carbon buildup (direct injection models):** The 2013-2018 models use direct injection only, which means fuel doesn't wash over the intake valves. Carbon deposits build up on the valves over time, causing rough idle and reduced power. Walnut blasting to clean the valves costs $300-$500 and is recommended around 80,000-100,000 miles. The 2019+ turbo and later NA models add port injection, which largely solves this problem.

**Oil consumption:** Some CX-5 owners report the 2.5L consuming a quart of oil every 3,000-5,000 miles after 100,000 miles. This is on the high side of normal for a direct injection engine but isn't necessarily a sign of failure. Monitor levels between changes.

**Timing chain:** The chain itself is durable and typically lasts the life of the engine. Timing chain tensioner wear is possible after 200,000 miles but is uncommon. No timing belt replacements to worry about.

**Spark plugs:** Iridium plugs last about 75,000 miles ($120-$180 for a set of four, installed).

## Transmission: The 6-Speed Automatic

The Skyactiv-Drive 6-speed automatic is one of the CX-5's strongest reliability points. It's a conventional torque converter automatic, not a CVT, and it uses a torque converter lock-up strategy that improves fuel economy without the durability concerns of a belt-driven CVT.

**Maintenance:** Change the fluid every 60,000 miles. Use Mazda's FZ fluid specification. Cost: $150-$250 at an independent shop. Ignore any claims about "lifetime" fluid.

**Failure rate:** Very low. NHTSA has minimal transmission-specific complaints for the CX-5 compared to CVT-equipped competitors. When these do fail (typically north of 200,000 miles), rebuild costs run $2,500-$3,500.

## AWD System: i-Activ

Mazda's i-Activ AWD uses a predictive system that monitors 27 different sensors to engage the rear wheels before slip occurs. It's a simple and lightweight system compared to Subaru's symmetrical AWD.

**Maintenance:** Rear differential fluid change every 30,000-60,000 miles ($80-$120). Often skipped by owners, which leads to premature wear.

**Durability:** The system is reliable with proper fluid changes. The most common AWD-specific repair is rear differential seal leaks around 100,000-150,000 miles ($200-$400).

## Maintenance Costs by Mileage

**0-60,000 miles:** $400-$600/year. Routine oil changes (every 7,500 miles with full synthetic), cabin/engine air filters, tire rotations, and brake inspections. Nothing exciting.

**60,000-120,000 miles:** $600-$1,000/year. Add transmission fluid change, brake pad/rotor replacement ($350-$600 for all four corners), spark plugs, and potentially walnut blasting for carbon buildup.

**120,000-200,000 miles:** $900-$1,500/year. Strut replacement ($600-$1,000 for all four), engine mounts ($300-$500), water pump ($250-$450), and various rubber components (CV boots, bushings).

**200,000+ miles:** $1,500-$2,500/year. Major items start appearing: potential timing chain service, suspension overhaul, and brake line replacement in rust-belt cars.

## CX-5 vs. the Competition

### vs. Toyota RAV4

The RAV4 wins on raw longevity (250,000-300,000 miles) and resale value. The CX-5 wins on driving dynamics, interior quality, and engagement. If you plan to keep the car until the wheels fall off, the RAV4 is the better bet. If you want something nicer to drive for 200,000 miles, the CX-5 is the pick.

### vs. Honda CR-V

Similar longevity potential. The 2017-2018 CR-V had the 1.5T oil dilution issue (TSB 18-075) that the CX-5 avoids entirely by not using a turbo on the base engine. The CR-V has more cargo space; the CX-5 has a better driving experience.

### vs. Subaru Forester

The Forester offers standard AWD and more ground clearance. The CX-5's i-Activ AWD is simpler and cheaper to maintain. Both have similar expected lifespans, but the CX-5 has lower annual maintenance costs ($400-$600 vs. $500-$800 for the Subaru).

## Best Model Years to Buy

**Best value:** 2019-2021 (mature second-gen, turbo option available, dual injection on turbo models, post-infotainment fix)

**Best budget option:** 2015-2016 first-gen with 2.5L engine (if rust-free)

**Avoid:** 2013 (first model year quirks) and any first-gen in heavy salt exposure areas without thorough underbody inspection

## The Bottom Line

The Mazda CX-5 is a solid 200,000-250,000 mile vehicle with straightforward maintenance needs. It won't quite match a RAV4 or CR-V in maximum lifespan, but it's a better driving experience, and the gap is smaller than most people think.

The key factors for CX-5 longevity: regular oil changes with full synthetic, transmission fluid changes every 60,000 miles, addressing carbon buildup on pre-2019 models, and (in the rust belt) proactive corrosion prevention.
