# Best Used SUVs Under $20,000 in 2026

Twenty thousand dollars opens up a solid range of used SUVs, but the spread between the best and worst options is enormous. Some models at this price will run another 150,000 miles without drama. Others will nickel-and-dime you into regretting the purchase within a year.

We focused on SUVs from 2017-2021 model years with proven reliability records, reasonable maintenance costs, and enough real-world data to know what breaks and when. Here's what's actually worth buying.

## Compact SUVs: Best Value Per Dollar

### 2018-2020 Toyota RAV4 (XA50)

**Typical Price:** $18,000-$19,500 at 60,000-90,000 miles
**Powertrain:** 2.5L Dynamic Force engine, 8-speed automatic

The fifth-gen RAV4 brought Toyota's newest engine platform to their best-selling model, and it shows. The Dynamic Force 2.5L is significantly more efficient and refined than the previous generation's engine while maintaining Toyota's reputation for going the distance.

**Why this generation specifically:** The XA50 (2019+) addressed most complaints from the previous generation. Better ride quality, improved cabin materials, and the new TNGA platform improved handling noticeably. The 2018 model year is technically the outgoing fourth-gen, which is also solid but shows its age inside.

**Known issues to watch:**
- Some 2019 models had transmission calibration issues causing hesitation. Toyota issued a TSB (software update) that fixes it. Ask if it's been applied
- Wind noise around the A-pillars at highway speed. Not a defect, just a design characteristic
- Rear differential noise on AWD models under hard acceleration. Usually doesn't progress or cause failure

**Annual maintenance cost:** $400-550. Oil changes, cabin/engine air filters, brake pads. Nothing exotic. The timing chain is good for the life of the engine.

### 2017-2020 Mazda CX-5 (KF)

**Typical Price:** $16,000-$19,000 at 50,000-80,000 miles
**Powertrain:** 2.5L Skyactiv-G, 6-speed automatic

The second-gen CX-5 is the pick if you want something that actually feels good to drive. Mazda tuned the chassis, steering, and ride quality like they were building a sports sedan that happens to be an SUV. Interior quality punches well above its price class.

**Reliability data:** NHTSA complaint rates for 2017-2020 CX-5 models average 40-60% lower than segment competitors. The Skyactiv-G 2.5L engine has no widespread failure patterns, and the 6-speed automatic (Mazda's own design) avoids the CVT reliability concerns that plague some competitors.

**Known issues:**
- Infotainment screen can develop unresponsive spots. Replacement runs $800-1,200 at a dealer
- Windshield cracks more easily than average due to a more upright rake angle
- Some owners report a slight vibration at idle around 80,000-100,000 miles. Usually motor mounts ($300-500 fix)

**Annual maintenance cost:** $380-500. Mazda parts are priced closer to Honda/Toyota than European brands.

### 2018-2020 Honda CR-V (RW)

**Typical Price:** $17,500-$19,800 at 60,000-85,000 miles
**Powertrain:** 1.5L turbocharged, CVT

The CR-V offers the most interior space in this class and Honda's typical thoughtful packaging. The 1.5L turbo provides adequate power with good fuel economy. The CVT is Honda's own unit, and while not as engaging as Mazda's traditional automatic, it's proven reliable across millions of Honda vehicles.

**The oil dilution issue:** Early 2017-2018 models in cold climates had reports of gasoline mixing into the oil. Honda addressed this with updated software and a revised oil recommendation. By the 2019 model year, complaints dropped significantly. If you're in a warmer climate, this is largely a non-issue. In cold states, check the oil at purchase and confirm the TSB update was performed.

**Known issues:**
- A/C condenser is vulnerable to road debris damage. Budget for a $600-900 repair if it happens
- Infotainment system can be sluggish, especially on base models. Not a reliability issue, just annoying
- Some vibration under acceleration between 40-60 mph. Usually CVT calibration, fixable with a software update

**Annual maintenance cost:** $400-550. Standard Honda reliability with standard Honda parts pricing.

## Midsize SUVs: Room for the Whole Family

### 2017-2019 Toyota Highlander (XU50)

**Typical Price:** $17,000-$19,500 at 80,000-110,000 miles
**Powertrain:** 3.5L 2GR-FKS V6, 8-speed automatic

The third-gen Highlander is the default recommendation for families who need three rows and don't want to think about their car. The 2GR V6 engine family has been in production since 2005 with a bulletproof track record. It makes 295 horsepower and does it without turbochargers, superchargers, or complicated direct injection systems.

**Why 2017-2019:** The 2017 refresh brought the newer 2GR-FKS engine with both direct and port injection (reducing carbon buildup issues), the 8-speed automatic (smoother than the previous 6-speed), and updated safety features including Toyota Safety Sense.

**Known issues:**
- Third-row seats are tight for adults. Fine for kids under 12
- Transmission can hunt between gears on hilly terrain. Not harmful, but noticeable
- Some 2017 models had a dashboard rattle from the instrument panel. Toyota issued a fix

**Annual maintenance cost:** $500-650. V6 uses more oil than four-cylinder competitors, and brake jobs are slightly pricier due to vehicle weight. Still straightforward maintenance.

### 2018-2020 Hyundai Santa Fe (TM)

**Typical Price:** $15,500-$18,500 at 50,000-75,000 miles
**Powertrain:** 2.4L GDI or 2.0T, 8-speed automatic

The redesigned Santa Fe represented Hyundai's jump to genuine competitiveness in the midsize SUV segment. Interior quality, ride comfort, and feature content all improved dramatically over the prior generation. The 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty (transferable to second owners) is a significant advantage for used buyers.

**Which engine:** The 2.4L naturally aspirated is the reliability pick. Simpler, fewer failure points, and adequate power for most drivers. The 2.0T is quicker but adds turbo complexity. Both pair with Hyundai's 8-speed automatic, which has proven reliable in high-volume production.

**Known issues:**
- 2.4L GDI engines from earlier Hyundai models (Sonata, Tucson) had bearing failure recalls. The Santa Fe TM uses an updated design, but verify the VIN against NHTSA recall database
- Infotainment can occasionally freeze. A restart fixes it
- Wind noise from the passenger side mirror at highway speed (some 2019 models)

**Annual maintenance cost:** $380-520. Hyundai parts are competitively priced, and the warranty provides peace of mind on major components.

## Full-Size SUVs: The Tough Calls

Full-size SUVs under $20K mean higher mileage, usually 100,000+. That narrows the field to models with proven longevity at those numbers.

### 2015-2017 Toyota 4Runner (N280)

**Typical Price:** $18,000-$20,000 at 100,000-130,000 miles
**Powertrain:** 4.0L 1GR-FE V6, 5-speed automatic

The 4Runner is the longevity champion in this class. The body-on-frame construction, tried-and-true 4.0L V6, and simple 5-speed automatic create a combination that routinely hits 300,000 miles. The 4Runner doesn't win on ride comfort, fuel economy, or interior refinement. It wins on being nearly indestructible.

**Why prices hold:** 4Runners depreciate more slowly than almost any SUV on the market. Finding one under $20K means accepting higher mileage, which is fine because this powertrain was designed for it. The 1GR-FE V6 has been in production since 2002 with minimal changes because it didn't need them.

**Known issues:**
- Frame rust in northern/salt states. Inspect the frame carefully. Toyota had a frame replacement program for earlier Tacomas with the same issue
- The 5-speed automatic shifts lazily by modern standards. It's by design, not a malfunction
- Rear suspension can sag with age. Replacement springs are $200-400 for the pair

**Annual maintenance cost:** $550-700. Higher fuel costs (17 mpg combined is optimistic) and larger tires offset cheap maintenance.

## What to Skip

**2017-2019 Nissan Rogue:** The CVT (Jatco unit) has well-documented reliability problems. Shuddering, overheating, and premature failure are common enough that extended CVT warranties exist. The savings aren't worth the risk.

**2016-2018 Kia Sorento with the 2.4L:** Same GDI engine bearing issue as the Hyundai Theta II. Some have been recalled, some haven't. The 3.3L V6 version is the safer bet.

**Any Land Rover under $20K:** Attractive styling, terrible ownership costs. A $18,000 Discovery Sport will need $4,000-6,000 in maintenance within the first year. Electronics, air suspension, turbo systems: everything is expensive to fix and prone to failure outside warranty.

## Before You Buy Any Used SUV

1. Get a pre-purchase inspection from an independent mechanic ($100-200 well spent)
2. Check NHTSA.gov for recalls specific to the VIN
3. Pull a vehicle history report (Carfax or AutoCheck)
4. Test drive for at least 30 minutes including highway and rough roads
5. Check the [Car Lifespan Check tool](/) to analyze any specific vehicle's expected remaining lifespan

The best used SUV is the one that fits your actual needs, not the one with the most features or the best deal on paper. Figure out what you need first (two rows or three, AWD or FWD, fuel economy priority or towing capacity), then work backward to find the right model at the right price.
