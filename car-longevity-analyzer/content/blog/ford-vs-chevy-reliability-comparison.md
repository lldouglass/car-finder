# Ford vs Chevy Reliability Comparison: Which Brand Actually Lasts Longer?

The Ford vs. Chevy debate has been running for over a century, and most of it is tribal loyalty rather than analysis. Both brands build some excellent vehicles and some problematic ones. The question isn't which brand is better overall; it's which specific vehicles from each brand are worth buying. Here's what the data shows across their truck, SUV, and car lineups.

## Overall Brand Reliability: A Tie (Seriously)

**Consumer Reports 2025 Brand Rankings:**
- Ford: #16 out of 28
- Chevrolet: #18 out of 28

**J.D. Power 2025 Vehicle Dependability Study:**
- Ford: 186 problems per 100 vehicles
- Chevrolet: 192 problems per 100 vehicles

**RepairPal Reliability Rating:**
- Ford: 3.5/5.0
- Chevrolet: 3.5/5.0

They're essentially the same in aggregate. The interesting differences emerge when you compare specific vehicle categories.

## Trucks: Where It Actually Matters

For most buyers in the Ford vs. Chevy debate, the real question is F-150 vs. Silverado 1500. This is where the rivalry lives.

### Ford F-150 vs. Chevrolet Silverado 1500

**Engines:**

Ford's approach is turbocharged EcoBoost engines (2.7L and 3.5L twin-turbo V6) alongside the naturally aspirated 5.0L Coyote V8. Chevy's approach is larger displacement naturally aspirated engines (5.3L and 6.2L V8) alongside a turbocharged 2.7L four-cylinder.

**Ford 3.5L EcoBoost:** Makes impressive power (400 hp in the Raptor, 375-400 in standard trucks) with strong towing numbers. Known issues include timing chain stretch on 2011-2013 models, intercooler condensation on 2013-2017 models, and carbon buildup inherent to direct injection. Turbo replacement cost: $1,200-$2,000 per side.

**Chevy 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 (2014+):** The 5.3L with Active Fuel Management (AFM, now called Dynamic Fuel Management) has a well-documented lifter failure problem. GM's AFM system deactivates cylinders for fuel economy, and the AFM lifters can collapse, causing misfires, ticking, and eventually camshaft damage. NHTSA has received thousands of complaints. Lifter and camshaft replacement runs $3,000-$5,000. This primarily affects 2014-2020 models with AFM. The 2021+ models with DFM (Dynamic Fuel Management) use a different lifter design that appears to be more reliable, but the data is still accumulating.

**Ford 5.0L Coyote V8:** Naturally aspirated, no AFM/cylinder deactivation (pre-2021), and a proven track record. The 2018-2020 cam phaser issue is annoying but well-documented with extended warranty coverage. This is the durability champion in the full-size truck engine comparison.

**Chevy 6.2L V8:** More power (420 hp) and genuinely sounds great. Uses the same AFM lifter system as the 5.3L, so the same lifter failure risk applies. Post-2021 models with DFM are showing better reliability.

**Winner (trucks): Ford, slightly.** The 5.0L Coyote has a better long-term track record than the 5.3L with AFM. However, if you're comparing the 3.5L EcoBoost to the 5.3L EcoTec3, it's closer to a wash, as both have significant known issues.

### Heavy Duty: Ford Super Duty vs. Silverado HD

**Ford 6.7L Power Stroke Diesel (2011+):** One of the most reliable diesel truck engines currently in production. The cab-over design (engine sits behind the front axle) makes service easier. Known issues include EGR cooler failures on 2011-2014 models ($2,000-$3,500) and DEF system problems across all years (common to all modern diesels). The 2017+ Power Stroke with the updated turbo and fuel system has been excellent.

**Chevy/GM 6.6L Duramax Diesel (L5P, 2017+):** Also an excellent engine. The L5P Duramax has fewer reported issues than the LML it replaced (which had fuel injector and DEF problems). The Allison 10-speed automatic paired with it is robust and well-proven.

**Winner (heavy duty): Tie.** Both the 6.7L Power Stroke and L5P Duramax are excellent engines. The Power Stroke has a slight edge in reliability data, but the Duramax/Allison combination has a longer heritage and better aftermarket support.

## SUVs: Tahoe/Suburban vs. Expedition

**Chevrolet Tahoe/Suburban (2021+):** Built on the T1XX platform with independent rear suspension. The 5.3L and 6.2L V8 engines carry the same AFM/DFM lifter concerns from the trucks. The 3.0L Duramax inline-six diesel option is new and has limited long-term data but early reports are positive.

**Ford Expedition (2018+):** Powered exclusively by the 3.5L EcoBoost V6. The Expedition is lighter than the Tahoe (aluminum body vs. steel) and the EcoBoost provides competitive power and towing. The 10-speed automatic had early shift quality issues (2018-2019) that were resolved through software updates.

**Known issue (Expedition-specific):** 2018-2019 Expeditions had reports of rear suspension failures related to the heavy-duty rear springs. Ford issued a recall on some configurations. Check recall status on any 2018-2019 Expedition.

**Winner (full-size SUVs): Close call, slight edge to Chevy.** The Tahoe's platform is more proven for this body style, and the Tahoe offers engine variety (V8 gas, V8 gas with more power, diesel). The Expedition's EcoBoost-only approach limits options, but the aluminum body resists rust better.

## Cars and Crossovers

### Ford Escape vs. Chevy Equinox

**Ford Escape (2020+):** Available with a 1.5T three-cylinder, 2.0T four-cylinder, or hybrid/PHEV. The 1.5T three-cylinder has been reliable but vibrates more than a four-cylinder. The hybrid system uses Toyota-sourced components (seriously) and has been very reliable.

**Chevy Equinox (2018-2023):** The 1.5T four-cylinder has been one of GM's more reliable recent engines. Lower maintenance costs than the Escape and a simpler powertrain. The 2024+ Equinox EV is too new for reliability data.

**Winner: Chevy Equinox, slightly.** More straightforward powertrain, lower repair costs, and fewer first-year issues.

### Ford Maverick vs. Chevy Colorado (Not Direct Competitors, But Often Cross-Shopped)

**Ford Maverick (2022+):** The hybrid version (2.5L Atkinson cycle + electric motor) gets 42 mpg city and uses the same hybrid system from the Escape. Very reliable so far. The 2.0L EcoBoost option adds power but introduces turbo maintenance. The Maverick is car-based and rides like one.

**Chevy Colorado (2023+):** Completely redesigned for 2023 with a 2.7L turbo four-cylinder as the sole engine. Too new for long-term data, but the 2.7L has been in the Silverado since 2019 and has shown decent reliability. Stiffer ride than the Maverick since it's a traditional body-on-frame truck.

## Maintenance Cost Comparison

**Average annual repair cost (RepairPal):**
- Ford: $775
- Chevrolet: $649

Chevy actually costs less to maintain on average, which surprises many people. This is partly because GM's V8 engines (when they're not having lifter issues) are simpler than Ford's turbocharged EcoBoost engines. No turbochargers, no intercoolers, no wastegate actuators.

**Common repair cost comparisons:**

| Repair | Ford F-150 (3.5 EB) | Silverado (5.3L) |
|--------|---------------------|------------------|
| Oil change (synthetic) | $75-$100 | $75-$100 |
| Brake job (all 4) | $400-$700 | $400-$650 |
| Spark plugs | $200-$350 | $200-$350 |
| Transmission fluid | $250-$400 | $200-$350 |
| Turbo replacement | $1,200-$2,000/ea | N/A |
| Lifter replacement | N/A | $3,000-$5,000 |

## Resale Value

Ford edges out Chevy in resale value across most vehicle categories, particularly trucks:

- F-150 retains roughly 55-60% of MSRP after 5 years
- Silverado retains roughly 50-55% after 5 years

The F-150's aluminum body (no rust), broader engine selection, and higher sales volume contribute to stronger resale.

## Best Vehicles from Each Brand

**Best Ford purchases:**
1. **F-150 with 5.0L Coyote V8 (2018+):** Best reliability/durability in the full-size truck class
2. **Maverick Hybrid:** Outstanding fuel economy, Toyota-derived hybrid system, and practical size
3. **Bronco Sport (2021+):** The 1.5L three-cylinder base engine is surprisingly capable and reliable

**Best Chevy purchases:**
1. **Silverado with 6.2L V8 (2021+, DFM):** The updated lifter design addresses the biggest reliability concern
2. **Equinox 1.5T (2018-2023):** Simple, reliable, affordable crossover
3. **Corvette C8 (2020+):** The LT2 6.2L V8 without AFM/DFM is a naturally aspirated powerhouse with excellent early reliability data

**Avoid from Ford:**
- 2017-2019 Expedition (suspension concerns, early 10-speed issues)
- Any F-150 with the 5.4L Triton V8 (spark plug ejection, cam phaser noise)

**Avoid from Chevy:**
- 2014-2020 Silverado/Sierra with 5.3L AFM (lifter failure risk)
- 2016-2019 Cruze with 1.4L turbo (PCV system failures, coolant leaks)

## The Bottom Line

There is no clear winner in the Ford vs. Chevy reliability debate because both brands have excellent and problematic vehicles in their lineups. The smart approach is to evaluate specific models, engines, and model years rather than choosing based on brand loyalty.

If you're buying a truck, the Ford 5.0L Coyote is the safer long-term choice over the Chevy 5.3L with AFM. If you're buying a crossover, the Chevy Equinox edges out the Ford Escape. If you're buying a full-size SUV, it's nearly a coin flip.

The real losers in the Ford vs. Chevy debate are buyers who pick based on the badge instead of the data. Both brands will sell you a 300,000-mile vehicle and a 100,000-mile headache. Know which is which before you sign.
