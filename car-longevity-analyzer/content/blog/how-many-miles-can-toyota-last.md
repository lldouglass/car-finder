## Factors That Affect Toyota Longevity

### Maintenance: The Make-or-Break Factor

**Critical maintenance intervals:**

**Oil Changes (Every 5,000-10,000 miles):**
- Toyota's 0W-20 synthetic oil can safely go 10,000 miles
- More frequent changes extend engine life
- Check oil level monthly, especially on high-mileage engines

**Transmission Service (Every 60,000-100,000 miles):**
- Toyota "WS" (World Standard) fluid is critical
- Never use generic ATF in Toyota transmissions
- Service prevents $3,000-5,000 transmission replacements

**Cooling System (Every 100,000 miles):**
- Toyota Super Long Life Coolant lasts 10 years/100,000 miles
- Overheating destroys engines quickly
- Replace thermostat and water pump together

**Timing Belt Service (Every 90,000-100,000 miles):**
- Required on most Toyota V6 engines through 2012
- Interference engines will destroy themselves if belt breaks
- Replace water pump simultaneously (labor overlap)

### Regional Factors

**Hot Climates (Arizona, Texas, Florida):**
- AC systems work harder but Toyota designs handle heat well
- More frequent coolant system attention required
- Paint and interior hold up better than most brands

**Cold Climates (Minnesota, Michigan, Northeast):**
- Toyota's rust protection improved dramatically after 2005
- Block heater recommended for extreme cold
- Synthetic oil crucial for cold-weather protection

**Salt Exposure:**
- 2000-2008 Tacoma and Tundra had frame rust issues (recall resolved)
- Modern Toyotas have excellent corrosion protection
- Regular undercarriage washing extends life significantly

### Driving Conditions Impact

**Highway vs. City Driving:**
- Highway driving extends Toyota life significantly
