# Best Japanese Cars for Reliability

Japanese automakers dominate reliability rankings, and it's not just brand loyalty talking. Consumer Reports' 2024 reliability survey has Toyota, Lexus, and Mazda in the top five. J.D. Power's 2024 Vehicle Dependability Study puts Lexus first and Toyota third. The data is consistent year after year.

But "Japanese cars are reliable" is too broad to be useful. Some Japanese cars are bulletproof. Others (looking at you, Nissan CVT) will leave you stranded. Here's which specific models, years, and engines to target, and which to avoid.

## Toyota: The Data Speaks for Itself

### Toyota Camry (2012-2017, 2018+)

**Engine:** 2AR-FE 2.5L (2012-2017), A25A-FKS 2.5L (2018+)
**Transmission:** 6-speed automatic (2012-2017), 8-speed automatic (2018+)
**Expected lifespan:** 250,000-300,000+ miles

The Camry is the baseline against which all other sedans are measured. The 2AR-FE engine in the 2012-2017 generation has been produced in the millions and its failure modes are well-documented and minor. The 6-speed automatic is a conventional planetary gear unit (not a CVT) that routinely lasts 250,000+ miles with fluid changes every 60,000 miles.

**Skip 2007-2009.** The 2AZ-FE 2.4L in those years had a piston ring design flaw causing excessive oil consumption. Toyota settled a class-action lawsuit over it.

**NHTSA data:** The 2014 Camry has 414 total complaints. The 2015 has 290. Compare that to a 2014 Nissan Altima at 1,748.

### Toyota Corolla (2009-2013, 2020+)

**Engine:** 2ZR-FE 1.8L (2009-2013), M20A-FKS 2.0L (2020+)
**Transmission:** 4-speed automatic (2009-2013), Direct Shift CVT (2020+)

The 2009-2013 Corolla paired the reliable 2ZR-FE with a 4-speed automatic that's borderline indestructible. It's not exciting, but it's the lowest-risk used car you can buy under $10K.

The 2020+ generation uses dual injection (port + direct), which prevents the carbon buildup that plagues many modern direct-injection engines. Early reliability data is excellent: the 2020 model has just 388 NHTSA complaints total.

### Toyota Tacoma (2005-2015, 2016+)

**Engine:** 1GR-FE 4.0L V6 (2005-2015), 1GR-FE 4.0L V6 or 2GR-FKS 3.5L V6 (2016+)
**Expected lifespan:** 300,000+ miles

The Tacoma's reputation is earned. The 1GR-FE V6 used from 2005-2015 is one of the most durable truck engines ever made. The biggest threat to a Tacoma isn't mechanical failure; it's frame rust. Toyota issued a frame replacement program for 2005-2010 Tacomas due to corrosion issues (Campaign SSC0E). If you're buying one, check frame condition first.

### Toyota 4Runner (2003-2009, 2010+)

**Engine:** 1GR-FE 4.0L V6
**Expected lifespan:** 300,000+ miles

Same 1GR-FE V6, body-on-frame construction, and conservative tuning. The 2010+ generation has been in production for over 15 years with minimal changes because Toyota knows better than to fix what isn't broken. NHTSA complaints are remarkably low: the 2015 4Runner has just 167 total complaints.

## Honda: Engineering Precision

### Honda Civic (2006-2011, 2012-2015, 2016-2021)

**8th gen (2006-2011):** 1.8L R18A1, 5-speed auto. Simple and reliable. Timing chain, port injection. The 2009-2011 years are the most refined.

**9th gen (2012-2015):** 1.8L R18Z1, CVT or 5-speed auto. Same basic engine formula. The CVT in these is Honda's own design and far more reliable than Nissan's Jatco unit.

**10th gen (2016-2021):** 2.0L K20C2 (base) or 1.5L L15B7 turbo. The 2.0L is the reliability pick. The 1.5T had well-documented oil dilution issues in cold climates (fuel mixing with oil during short trips). Honda addressed this with a software update and extended warranty, but the 2.0L avoids the issue entirely.

**Expected lifespan:** 200,000-300,000 miles across all generations.

### Honda Accord (2008-2012, 2013-2017, 2018+)

**8th gen (2008-2012):** 2.4L K24Z3, 5-speed auto. The K24 engine family is Honda's best. Avoid the V6 automatic (torque converter shudder issues). The four-cylinder with 5-speed auto is the combination to target.

**9th gen (2013-2017):** 2.4L K24W1, CVT. Still a K24, still reliable. The CVT is Honda's design and holds up well.

**10th gen (2018+):** 1.5L L15BE turbo or 2.0L K20C4 turbo. Both are proving reliable, but the 1.5T has the same cold-climate oil dilution potential as the Civic 1.5T. If you live somewhere with harsh winters, the 2.0T is the better pick.

### Honda CR-V (2007-2011, 2012-2016, 2017+)

**3rd gen (2007-2011):** 2.4L K24Z1, 5-speed auto. Excellent. Same K24 family, same durability.

**4th gen (2012-2016):** 2.4L K24W4, CVT. Still reliable.

**5th gen (2017+):** 1.5L L15BE turbo, CVT. Good overall, but the 2017-2018 models had a well-documented oil dilution issue (TSB 18-075). Honda updated the engine control software and modified the system for 2019+. If buying a 2017-2018, check that the TSB was performed.

## Mazda: The Dark Horse

Mazda has surged in reliability rankings since introducing the Skyactiv platform in 2012. Consumer Reports now ranks Mazda alongside Toyota and Lexus.

### Mazda3 (2014-2018, 2019+)

**Engine:** Skyactiv-G 2.0L or 2.5L PE-VPS
**Transmission:** 6-speed automatic or 6-speed manual

Mazda uses a conventional 6-speed automatic, not a CVT. The Skyactiv-G engines are naturally aspirated with high compression ratios (13:1), timing chains, and (on 2019+ models) dual port/direct injection. NHTSA complaint volumes are low: the 2018 Mazda3 has 137 total complaints.

**The rust caveat:** Pre-2014 Mazdas (and some early Skyactiv models) had documented corrosion problems, especially in salt-belt states. Inspect subframes and wheel arches carefully on any Mazda in the Northern US or Canada.

### Mazda CX-5 (2013-2016, 2017+)

**Engine:** Skyactiv-G 2.5L (most common), 2.5L turbo (2019+)
**Expected lifespan:** 200,000-250,000 miles

The CX-5 is the compact SUV segment's reliability dark horse. Same Skyactiv platform and engines as the Mazda3. The 2017+ second generation improved build quality, sound insulation, and interior materials significantly. The naturally aspirated 2.5L is the reliability pick; the turbo is newer with less long-term data.

## Lexus: Toyota's Luxury Division

Lexus has topped the J.D. Power Vehicle Dependability Study more times than any other brand. These are mechanically Toyota vehicles with nicer interiors.

### Lexus ES 350 (2007-2012, 2013-2018, 2019+)

**Engine:** 2GR-FE 3.5L V6 (2007-2018), A25A-FKS 2.5L hybrid or 2.5L (2019+)
**Expected lifespan:** 250,000-300,000+ miles

The 2GR-FE V6 is one of Toyota's best engines. It's been used across dozens of Toyota and Lexus models since 2005, and pattern failures are almost nonexistent. The 6-speed automatic is equally proven.

### Lexus RX 350 (2010-2015, 2016+)

Same 2GR-FE V6, same reliability. The RX has been the best-selling luxury SUV in America for decades, and the service data reflects near-perfect mechanical reliability. The biggest expense is typically brake jobs ($400-$600 front and rear) and strut replacement around 100,000-120,000 miles ($800-$1,200).

## Subaru: Reliable with Caveats

### The Head Gasket Era Is Over

Subaru's EJ25 2.5L engine (used through approximately 2011-2012 in most models) was notorious for external head gasket leaks. Repair cost: $1,500-$2,500.

The FB-series engines (FB20, FB25) introduced starting in 2012-2013 resolved this issue with a different head gasket design. If you're buying a Subaru, target 2013+ models with the FB engine.

### Subaru Outback (2015-2019)

**Engine:** FB25 2.5L boxer
**Transmission:** Lineartronic CVT
**Expected lifespan:** 200,000-250,000 miles

The 2015+ Outback is a solid choice with standard AWD and decent reliability. The CVT should have fluid changed every 60,000 miles (Subaru says longer, but independent mechanics disagree). NHTSA data is reasonable: the 2017 Outback has 466 complaints, mostly minor.

### Subaru Forester (2014-2018, 2019+)

Same FB25 engine, same platform as the Outback. The 2019+ generation added EyeSight driver assist as standard on most trims, making it a strong safety pick.

## Japanese Cars to Avoid

### Nissan (2007-2020 CVT Models)

The Jatco CVT used in the Altima, Sentra, Versa, Rogue, and Pathfinder is a well-documented reliability disaster. NHTSA has thousands of transmission complaints for these models. The 2013 Altima alone has over 2,400 total NHTSA complaints, with the majority related to CVT failure.

The CVT typically fails between 60,000-120,000 miles with symptoms of shuddering, whining, and loss of power. Replacement costs $3,500-5,000. Nissan extended warranty coverage to 10 years/120,000 miles on some models due to the volume of complaints, but many are now outside that window.

**The engines are fine.** Nissan's QR25DE and VQ35DE engines are actually quite reliable. It's the transmission that kills these cars.

### Mitsubishi (Current Lineup)

Mitsubishi has been disinvesting from the US market for years. The model range is limited, dealer networks are thin, and long-term parts availability is a concern. The Outlander uses a Jatco CVT shared with Nissan. Reliability data isn't terrible, but there are better options.

## The Bottom Line

Japanese automakers earn their reliability reputation, but only if you choose the right models and years. A 2014 Toyota Camry and a 2014 Nissan Altima are both "Japanese cars," but their reliability couldn't be more different.

Always check specific model year data before buying. Use [Car Lifespan Check](https://carlifespancheck.com) to look up NHTSA complaint counts, common problems, and reliability ratings for the exact year and model you're considering. The brand on the badge matters less than the specific engine, transmission, and model year under the hood.
