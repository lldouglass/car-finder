# Best Used Cars for the Money in 2026: Cost Per Year Rankings

The average 1 to 5 year old used car costs over $30,000 right now. That's 50% more than five years ago. At these prices, reliability and remaining lifespan become the two most important factors in your purchase decision. A $25,000 car that lasts 12 more years costs you $2,083 per year. A $20,000 car that lasts 6 more years costs $3,333. The cheaper car is actually more expensive.

Here's how the most popular used cars stack up when you measure what actually matters: cost per year of remaining useful life.

## How We Calculate Cost Per Year

Take the average used price. Divide by expected remaining lifespan in years. That gives you the annual cost of ownership just for the vehicle itself (before insurance, gas, and maintenance). Lower is better.

This approach penalizes cars that depreciate slowly but don't last long, and rewards cars that hold value precisely because they keep running. It's the metric that separates genuinely good deals from cars that just look cheap on the lot.

## Best 5-Year-Old Used Cars for the Money

These are 2021 model year vehicles. Old enough to have depreciated meaningfully, new enough to have plenty of life left.

### 1. Honda Fit: $1,693 Per Year

Average used price: $18,445. Expected remaining life: 10.9 years.

The Honda Fit is the undisputed champion of used car value. It costs roughly half the average per-year cost of a 5-year-old used car ($3,310). The 1.5L engine is simple and proven. The Magic Seat system makes it more practical than cars twice its size. Insurance is cheap. Gas mileage is excellent.

The downside: Honda discontinued the Fit in the US after 2020, so the newest ones are actually 2020 models. That makes the remaining 2021 (carry-over) inventory increasingly scarce and potentially more valuable over time.

### 2. Toyota Corolla: ~$1,800 Per Year

Average used price: around $20,000. Expected remaining life: 11+ years.

Nobody gets excited about a Corolla, and that's exactly the point. The 2.0L naturally aspirated engine has no turbo to fail, no CVT to slip (the base uses a traditional CVT, but Toyota's implementation is far more reliable than Nissan's or Subaru's), and maintenance costs stay under $500 per year on average.

The 2021+ Corolla also has Toyota Safety Sense 2.0 standard on every trim, which means adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, and automatic emergency braking. That's real safety equipment for used car money.

### 3. Kia Forte: ~$1,900 Per Year

Average used price: around $17,500. Expected remaining life: 9.2 years.

Kia has been quietly building some of the most reliable compact cars on the market. The Forte uses a 2.0L naturally aspirated engine (same basic architecture as the Hyundai Elantra) that's proven to be durable. The big advantage: Kia's 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty still has significant coverage left on a 5-year-old car.

The catch: resale values are lower than Honda and Toyota, which is actually what makes the cost-per-year math so attractive. You pay less upfront for comparable longevity.

### 4. Honda Civic: ~$2,100 Per Year

Average used price: around $23,500. Expected remaining life: 11.2 years.

The Civic costs more than the Fit but lasts slightly longer. The 2.0L base engine is bulletproof. The 1.5T turbo has proven more reliable than early critics expected, though the naturally aspirated engine remains the safer long-term bet.

Civics hold their value better than almost any other compact car, which means you pay more upfront. But you also get more back when you eventually sell. Factor in the resale value and the true cost of ownership drops further.

### 5. Toyota Camry: ~$2,200 Per Year

Average used price: around $25,000. Expected remaining life: 11.4 years.

The Camry is bigger, more comfortable, and costs more than the compacts above. But the expected lifespan is also longer. The 2.5L 4-cylinder engine is one of the most proven powertrains in production. Annual maintenance costs typically run $400 to $600.

The hybrid version is worth considering: similar reliability to the gas model, significantly better fuel economy (around 50 MPG combined), and the hybrid battery has proven durable well past 200,000 miles in most cases.

## Best 10-Year-Old Used Cars for the Money

These are 2016 model year vehicles. Significantly cheaper, but you're buying fewer remaining years of service.

### 1. Nissan Leaf: ~$1,108 Per Year

Average used price: $5,675. Expected remaining life: 5.1 years.

The cheapest cost per year on this list, but there's a major caveat: the 2016 Leaf has a small battery (30 kWh max) with no active thermal management. Range was around 107 miles when new, and battery degradation means real-world range is likely 60 to 80 miles by now.

If your commute is under 40 miles round trip and you have home charging, this is genuinely the cheapest transportation available. If you need more range or flexibility, keep reading.

### 2. Tesla Model S: ~$2,500 Per Year

Average used price: around $28,000. Expected remaining life: 11.2 years.

This is where it gets interesting. A 10-year-old Tesla Model S costs almost three times the Leaf but has more than double the remaining lifespan. The larger battery pack degrades more gracefully, the drivetrain has far fewer moving parts than any gas car, and Tesla's over-the-air updates keep adding features years after purchase.

The risk: repair costs when something does break are significantly higher than a Honda or Toyota. Tesla parts and labor aren't cheap. But if the major components hold up (and data suggests they usually do), the total cost of ownership competes with much cheaper gas cars.

### 3. Toyota Prius: ~$1,800 Per Year

Average used price: around $13,500. Expected remaining life: 7.5 years.

The 2016 Prius is the fourth generation, which is the best one Toyota made up to that point. The hybrid battery is proving remarkably durable, with most lasting well past 200,000 miles. Fuel costs at 50+ MPG are trivial.

The Prius is boring. That's the whole point. Nothing exciting means nothing breaks.

### 4. Honda Accord: ~$2,000 Per Year

Average used price: around $16,000. Expected remaining life: 8 years.

The 2016 Accord uses a 2.4L naturally aspirated engine with a conventional 6-speed automatic in the LX/Sport trims. No turbo, no CVT, no complicated technology to fail. This is about as mechanically straightforward as a midsize sedan gets.

The V6 models are faster and still reliable, but the 4-cylinder is the smart money pick for maximum longevity.

### 5. Toyota RAV4: ~$2,200 Per Year

Average used price: around $18,500. Expected remaining life: 8.4 years.

If you need an SUV, the RAV4 is the cost-per-year winner in this segment. The 2.5L engine is shared with the Camry, and it's proven across millions of vehicles. The AWD system is simple and durable.

The 2016 RAV4 won't wow you with driving dynamics, but it'll still be running when flashier SUVs from the same year have been scrapped.

## The Cars to Avoid

Some cars look cheap on paper but cost a fortune per remaining year because they don't last:

**Nissan Altima 2016 (CVT models)**: Average used price is low, but the JATCO CVT transmission has well-documented reliability problems. Expected remaining life is shorter than average, and a CVT replacement costs $3,000 to $4,000.

**BMW 3 Series 2016**: Depreciation makes them tempting, but maintenance and repair costs for a 10-year-old BMW often exceed $2,000 per year. The cost-per-year math falls apart when you add in upkeep.

**Chrysler 200 2016**: Rock-bottom prices for a reason. Poor reliability scores, cheap interior materials that age badly, and limited parts availability as the model was discontinued. Cheap to buy, expensive to own.

## How to Pick the Right Value Car for You

1. **Calculate cost per year yourself.** Take the asking price, estimate remaining lifespan based on the model's track record, divide. Compare across your shortlist.

2. **Factor in maintenance costs.** A Toyota at $2,200/year with $500/year maintenance costs $2,700 total. A BMW at $1,800/year with $2,000/year maintenance costs $3,800.

3. **Check real reliability data.** Use [Car Lifespan Check](https://carlifespancheck.com) to pull NHTSA complaint data and reliability scores for any specific make, model, and year. Pattern matters more than individual reviews.

4. **Buy the right age.** Five-year-old cars cost more but give you more remaining life and newer safety features. Ten-year-old cars are cheaper per year on paper but you're buying less total time.

5. **Get a pre-purchase inspection.** This applies to every car on this list. Even the most reliable model can be a disaster if the previous owner never changed the oil. A $150 inspection can save you thousands.

The used car market is expensive right now. The best way to fight that is to buy the cars that keep running longest per dollar spent. The data consistently points to Honda, Toyota, and a few well-chosen alternatives.
