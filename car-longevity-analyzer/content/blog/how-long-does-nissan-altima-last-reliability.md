# How Long Does a Nissan Altima Last?

The honest answer depends entirely on which generation you're talking about. A 2004-2006 Altima with the 4-speed automatic can go 250,000+ miles without drama. A 2013-2016 Altima with the Xtronic CVT might not make it to 100,000.

The Nissan Altima's reliability story is really two different stories: the pre-CVT era (solid, dependable) and the CVT era (a well-documented transmission reliability disaster). Here's the data.

## Generation-by-Generation Breakdown

### 3rd Generation (2002-2006): The Reliable One

**Engine:** QR25DE 2.5L or VQ35DE 3.5L V6
**Transmission:** 4-speed automatic or 5-speed manual
**Expected lifespan:** 220,000-280,000 miles

This is peak Altima reliability. The QR25DE 2.5L four-cylinder is a simple, naturally aspirated engine with a timing chain (not belt). The 4-speed automatic is a Jatco RE4F04B unit that's been used across millions of Nissan vehicles and has a strong durability record.

**NHTSA complaint data:** The 2005 Altima has 832 total complaints, but most are related to the specific recall campaigns (catalytic converter, crankshaft sensor) rather than pattern failures. The engine and transmission themselves hold up well.

**Known problems:**
- Catalytic converter premature failure around 80,000-100,000 miles. This was widespread enough that several states (California, New York) extended emissions warranty coverage. Replacement: $800-$1,500 depending on state emissions requirements
- Crankshaft position sensor failures causing stalling (Nissan Campaign R0608). Cheap fix: $150-$250
- Pre-cat failure can send ceramic material into the engine on the 2.5L, causing internal scoring. If you hear rattling from the exhaust area, get it checked immediately

**The V6 option:** The VQ35DE 3.5L V6 paired with the 5-speed automatic (RE5R05A) is actually the more robust powertrain in this generation. The VQ35DE is one of Nissan's best engines, regularly lasting 300,000+ miles. It was on Ward's 10 Best Engines list for 14 consecutive years.

### 4th Generation (2007-2012): The Transition

**Engine:** QR25DE 2.5L or VQ35DE 3.5L V6
**Transmission:** Xtronic CVT (2.5L), 6-speed manual (2.5L), or CVT/6-speed manual (V6 coupe)
**Expected lifespan:** 150,000-220,000 miles (CVT dependent)

This generation introduced the Jatco CVT (JF011E) to the Altima sedan. It was the beginning of the reliability decline.

**CVT reality in this generation:** The JF011E CVT is actually more reliable than the later JF015E/JF016E units. It uses a steel push belt rather than a chain, and while it does fail, the failure rate is lower than in 2013+ models. Expect the CVT to last 120,000-180,000 miles with proper maintenance.

**NHTSA data:**
- 2007: 1,595 complaints (first year with CVT, lots of transmission reports)
- 2008: 1,073 complaints
- 2010: 735 complaints
- 2012: 659 complaints

The declining complaint count shows Nissan improved the CVT calibration over time, but transmission complaints remain the top category every year.

**Known problems:**
- CVT juddering and whining under acceleration ($3,500-$4,500 for replacement if it fails)
- Exhaust flex pipe cracking around 80,000-100,000 miles ($200-$400)
- Steering lock module failure causing no-start condition. Nissan issued a recall (Campaign PC384) and then a voluntary service campaign. If buying one, confirm this was addressed

**If you want one from this era:** Find a 2010-2012 with the 2.5L and a manual transmission, or a V6 coupe with the 6-speed manual. The CVT models are manageable if you change the fluid every 30,000 miles with Nissan NS-2 fluid, but it's always a gamble.

### 5th Generation (2013-2018): The CVT Crisis

**Engine:** QR25DE 2.5L
**Transmission:** Xtronic CVT (JF015E/JF016E)
**Expected lifespan:** 100,000-160,000 miles (CVT is the limiting factor)

This is the generation that destroyed Nissan's reliability reputation. The updated Xtronic CVT (JF015E for the first few years, then JF016E) has one of the worst failure rates of any modern transmission.

**The numbers are brutal.** NHTSA complaint data:
- 2013: 2,449 complaints (the worst year for any midsize sedan in NHTSA's database)
- 2014: 1,748 complaints
- 2015: 1,201 complaints
- 2016: 898 complaints
- 2017: 532 complaints
- 2018: 361 complaints

The 2013-2014 model years are catastrophic. Transmission complaints dominate, with owners reporting CVT failure as early as 30,000-40,000 miles. Nissan extended the powertrain warranty to 10 years/120,000 miles on 2013-2017 CVTs due to the volume of failures, but many of those warranties have now expired.

**CVT failure symptoms:**
- Whining noise that increases with speed
- Shuddering or vibration during acceleration
- Delayed engagement when shifting from Park to Drive
- RPMs climbing without corresponding acceleration (belt slipping)
- Complete loss of drive (the belt or pulleys fail internally)

**CVT replacement cost:** $3,800-$5,500 installed. On a car worth $6,000-$10,000, this is often a total loss economically.

**The engine is fine.** The QR25DE 2.5L itself continues to be a decent engine. Oil changes every 5,000 miles (not the 7,500 Nissan recommends), quality synthetic oil, and air filter changes keep the engine healthy. The catalytic converter still fails prematurely on some units ($800-$1,200).

### 6th Generation (2019-2024): Slightly Better, Still Risky

**Engine:** QR25DE 2.5L or KR20DDET 2.0L VC-Turbo
**Transmission:** Xtronic CVT (updated)
**Expected lifespan:** TBD (insufficient long-term data)

Nissan updated the CVT for the 2019 redesign, and early data suggests improvement. NHTSA complaints dropped to 529 for the 2019 model year, though that's still higher than competitors. The transmission still uses the same fundamental CVT design, just with revised software calibration and improved cooling.

**The VC-Turbo engine** is a technological marvel (variable compression ratio, a first in production cars) and a long-term reliability question mark. It has significantly more moving parts than a conventional engine, and there's no 10+ year reliability data yet. Reports of excessive oil consumption and turbo failures have appeared in small numbers, but it's too early to identify pattern failures.

**If buying new or recent:** The 2.5L with the updated CVT is the lower-risk choice. Change CVT fluid every 30,000 miles with Nissan NS-3 fluid regardless of what the maintenance schedule says.

## The CVT Maintenance Reality

If you own or are considering any CVT-equipped Altima, here's what you need to know:

**"Lifetime" fluid is a myth.** Nissan's maintenance schedule for many CVT-equipped models originally stated the CVT fluid was "lifetime" and never needed changing under normal conditions. This is the single worst piece of maintenance advice in modern automotive history. Independent transmission specialists universally recommend CVT fluid changes every 30,000-40,000 miles.

**Use the correct fluid.** Nissan NS-2 for 2007-2012 models, NS-3 for 2013+. Using the wrong specification or generic CVT fluid accelerates wear.

**Fluid changes extend life but don't guarantee it.** Regular maintenance can stretch a problematic CVT from 80,000 to 150,000 miles, but it can't fix a fundamental design weakness. Some units fail regardless.

**Don't flush, drain and fill.** A power flush on a high-mileage CVT that's never been serviced can dislodge debris and cause immediate failure. If you're buying a used Altima with 80,000+ miles and no CVT service history, do a drain-and-fill (about 4 quarts), drive 500 miles, and repeat.

## Cost of Ownership: Altima vs. Competitors

### 5-Year Ownership Cost (2015 Model Year, Purchased at 60,000 Miles)

**Nissan Altima 2.5 CVT:**
- Purchase: ~$10,000
- Routine maintenance: $3,000-$4,000
- CVT replacement (probable): $4,000-$5,500
- Other repairs: $1,500-$2,500
- **Total: $18,500-$22,000**

**Toyota Camry 2.5 (6-speed auto):**
- Purchase: ~$13,000
- Routine maintenance: $2,500-$3,500
- Major repairs (unlikely): $500-$1,500
- **Total: $16,000-$18,000**

**Honda Accord 2.4 (CVT):**
- Purchase: ~$12,500
- Routine maintenance: $2,500-$3,500
- Major repairs: $800-$2,000
- **Total: $15,800-$18,000**

The Altima's lower purchase price is a trap. The CVT replacement alone erases the savings and then some.

## Buying Recommendations

**Best Altima to buy:** 2004-2006 with the 2.5L and 4-speed automatic, or the 3.5L V6 with any transmission. Pre-CVT, proven reliable.

**Acceptable risk:** 2010-2012 with CVT if you can verify regular fluid changes and the car has under 80,000 miles. Budget for potential CVT replacement.

**Avoid:** 2013-2016 with CVT. The failure rates are too high and the repair cost too severe relative to vehicle value.

**Too early to judge:** 2019+ with either engine. The updated CVT shows improvement, but there isn't enough 150,000+ mile data to know if the improvements hold.

## Check Before You Buy

Run any Altima through [Car Lifespan Check](https://carlifespancheck.com) to see NHTSA complaint data, recall status, and reliability ratings for the specific model year. Given the dramatic reliability differences between Altima generations, checking the data before buying isn't optional. It's essential.
