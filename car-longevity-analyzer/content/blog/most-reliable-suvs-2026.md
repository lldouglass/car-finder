# Most Reliable SUVs in 2026: Data-Driven Rankings

SUVs dominate the American car market, but not all of them are built to last. Some SUVs routinely hit 200,000 miles with minimal issues, while others start nickel-and-diming owners before 100,000 miles. The difference comes down to engineering choices: which engines, transmissions, and platforms have proven themselves over hundreds of thousands of real-world miles.

This guide ranks the most reliable SUVs you can buy in 2026, based on NHTSA complaint data, owner longevity reports, and known mechanical track records. Whether you are buying new or shopping used, these are the SUVs most likely to go the distance.

## How We Rank Reliability

Our rankings consider three key factors:

1. **NHTSA complaint density** (complaints per thousand vehicles sold)
2. **Known powertrain longevity** (how far the engine and transmission typically last)
3. **Owner-reported long-term satisfaction** (forums, surveys, and service records)

A "reliable" SUV is not just one that avoids recalls. It is one that requires minimal unplanned maintenance over 150,000 to 250,000 miles of ownership.

## Tier 1: The Best of the Best

### Toyota 4Runner

The 4Runner is arguably the most reliable SUV ever built. The fifth-generation model (2010 to 2024) used Toyota's 4.0L 1GR-FE V6, an engine with a documented track record of exceeding 300,000 miles with basic maintenance. The five-speed automatic in these models is similarly bulletproof.

**Best model years:** 2015 to 2023. These years benefit from mid-cycle refinements while avoiding the first-year teething issues of the 2010 model. NHTSA complaint counts for 2015 to 2020 models average fewer than 150 complaints per model year, which is remarkably low for a vehicle sold in these volumes.

**Common problems to watch for:** The 4Runner is not perfect. The 2010 to 2013 models had reports of cracked dashboards (a cosmetic issue, not mechanical). Some owners report a slight shimmy at highway speeds related to brake rotor warping, especially on models driven hard off-road. The rear suspension can develop a sag after 120,000 miles on models that tow frequently.

**What to avoid:** The 2025 sixth-generation 4Runner moved to a turbocharged 2.4L four-cylinder (the T24A-FTS). While Toyota's turbo engines are well-engineered, there is no long-term reliability data yet. If longevity is your priority, stick with the proven 4.0L V6 in the fifth generation.

### Toyota RAV4

The RAV4 has been one of the best-selling SUVs in America for years, and reliability data backs up its popularity. The fourth-generation (2013 to 2018) and fifth-generation (2019 to 2025) models both deliver strong longevity.

**Best model years:** 2017 to 2020 with the 2.5L 2AR-FE (fourth gen) or 2.5L Dynamic Force (fifth gen). The 2019+ models with the Dynamic Force engine achieve better fuel economy and produce fewer NHTSA complaints than their predecessors. The 2019 RAV4 has roughly 250 NHTSA complaints on file, while the 2020 has around 150, a significant drop.

**Common problems to watch for:** The 2019 to 2020 RAV4 had a notable issue with transmission hesitation during low-speed acceleration. Toyota issued a TSB (Technical Service Bulletin) with a software update that largely resolved the issue. Make sure any used 2019 to 2020 has had this update applied. Some 2013 to 2015 models had excessive oil consumption on the 2.5L engine; check service records for oil consumption complaints.

**What to avoid:** The 2006 to 2012 RAV4 V6 models used the 2GR-FE engine, which is reliable, but was paired with a transmission that some owners reported failing between 100,000 and 150,000 miles. Stick with the four-cylinder for maximum longevity in those years.

### Lexus GX

The Lexus GX is essentially a luxury-trimmed Toyota 4Runner/Land Cruiser Prado, and it inherits the same legendary reliability. The GX 460 (2010 to 2023) used the 4.6L 1UR-FE V8, a naturally aspirated engine known for reaching 250,000+ miles.

**Best model years:** 2014 to 2022. The 2014 refresh brought updated styling and improved interior quality. NHTSA data shows these model years averaging under 100 complaints each, which is excellent for a vehicle in this price range.

**Common problems to watch for:** The GX 460 uses a full-time four-wheel-drive system with a Torsen center differential. While durable, the transfer case fluid needs to be changed every 30,000 miles to prevent premature wear. Air suspension models (mostly the Luxury trim) can develop air spring leaks after 100,000 miles, costing $500 to $1,500 per corner to replace.

### Honda CR-V

The CR-V has been a reliability staple for decades, though not every generation is equal. The third-generation (2007 to 2011) and fourth-generation (2012 to 2016) CR-Vs are the longevity champions.

**Best model years:** 2015 to 2016 (fourth generation). These models used the 2.4L K24W engine, a proven Honda powerplant that regularly exceeds 200,000 miles. The CVT in these models is more reliable than the unit Honda used in later models. NHTSA complaints for the 2015 CR-V sit around 200, mostly related to minor electrical issues.

**Common problems to watch for:** The 2015 to 2016 models can develop a vibration at idle related to the AC compressor. It is annoying but not a reliability concern. More importantly, the 2012 to 2014 models had reports of vibration issues that Honda addressed with updated engine mounts under a service campaign.

**What to avoid:** The 2017 to 2019 CR-V with the 1.5L turbo had a well-documented oil dilution problem in cold climates. Fuel would mix with engine oil, raising oil levels and potentially damaging the engine long-term. Honda released a software fix, but many owners remained dissatisfied. If you want a fifth-gen CR-V, the 2020+ models are safer choices as Honda refined the engine calibration.

## Tier 2: Excellent Reliability

### Mazda CX-5

Mazda does not get the same reliability hype as Toyota or Honda, but the CX-5 has quietly built an excellent track record since its 2013 debut. The second-generation CX-5 (2017+) with the 2.5L Skyactiv-G engine is particularly strong.

**Best model years:** 2019 to 2024. These years resolved early infotainment bugs that plagued 2017 to 2018 models. The naturally aspirated 2.5L is a simple, direct-injection engine with no turbo to fail and no CVT to worry about. It pairs with a conventional six-speed automatic that shifts smoothly and lasts.

**Common problems to watch for:** Some owners report carbon buildup on intake valves due to direct injection (common across all DI engines). An intake walnut blast every 60,000 to 80,000 miles prevents this. The infotainment system in 2017 to 2018 models had freezing and rebooting issues; make sure the latest software update has been applied.

### Subaru Forester

The Forester offers standard all-wheel drive and solid reliability, though Subaru's history with head gasket issues on older models gives some buyers pause. The good news: modern Foresters have largely overcome that reputation.

**Best model years:** 2019 to 2023 (fifth generation). These models use the FB25D 2.5L boxer engine with direct injection and a CVT (Lineartronic). While CVTs have a mixed reputation, Subaru's Lineartronic has proven more durable than many competitors' units, with most owners reporting trouble-free operation past 150,000 miles. NHTSA complaint counts for the 2020 Forester are around 120.

**Common problems to watch for:** Oil consumption on the 2011 to 2016 Forester (FB25 engine without direct injection) was a known issue. Subaru extended the warranty to 100,000 miles for excessive oil consumption on those models. The 2019+ direct injection version largely resolved this. Some 2019 models had a software glitch causing the auto start-stop system to stall; a dealer update fixes this.

**What to avoid:** The 2014 to 2016 Forester XT turbo used the FA20DIT engine. While fun to drive, the turbo adds complexity and the CVT in these models was stressed harder. For reliability, stick with the naturally aspirated 2.5L.

### Hyundai Tucson (2022+)

This might surprise some readers, but the 2022+ Tucson has shown strong early reliability data. It uses Hyundai's Smartstream 2.5L four-cylinder with an eight-speed automatic (not a CVT), a conventional and proven drivetrain setup.

**Best model years:** 2023 to 2025. The first-year 2022 models had some infotainment bugs and minor trim pieces that rattled. By 2023, Hyundai had addressed most of these issues. NHTSA complaints for the 2023 Tucson are lower than many competitors.

**Common problems to watch for:** Hyundai's earlier engines (the Theta II 2.0L and 2.4L) had catastrophic failure and fire risks that led to massive recalls. The Smartstream 2.5L is a completely different engine family and does not share those problems. However, buyer anxiety about Hyundai engine reliability is understandable. Check that any used Tucson is up to date on all recalls.

**What to avoid:** Do not confuse the conventional Tucson with the Tucson Hybrid or PHEV, which use a different powertrain (1.6T + electric motor + six-speed automatic). The hybrid drivetrain is good but has less long-term data.

## Tier 3: Good Reliability with Caveats

### Toyota Highlander

The Highlander is a solid three-row SUV, but it sits in Tier 3 rather than Tier 1 because certain model years have notable issues.

**Best model years:** 2017 to 2019 (third generation) with the 3.5L 2GR-FKS V6 and eight-speed automatic. This combination is refined and durable. The 2020+ fourth generation is also good, but the eight-speed automatic in early 2020 models had some reports of rough shifting.

**Common problems to watch for:** The 2014 to 2016 Highlander V6 with the six-speed automatic is the most reliable configuration, but some owners reported transmission shudder around 60,000 miles. A transmission fluid drain-and-fill often resolves this. The 2008 to 2013 Highlander V6 is also reliable, but the 2.7L four-cylinder option in those years is underpowered and should be avoided.

### Ford Bronco Sport

The Bronco Sport (not the full-size Bronco) uses Ford's 1.5L EcoBoost three-cylinder or 2.0L EcoBoost four-cylinder. The 2.0L in the Badlands and First Edition trims pairs with a more capable all-wheel-drive system.

**Best model years:** 2023 to 2025. Early 2021 to 2022 models had some quality control issues, including soft paint, wind noise, and occasional electrical gremlins. Ford addressed most of these by 2023. The 1.5L three-cylinder has proven surprisingly durable, though long-term data past 100,000 miles is still limited.

**Common problems to watch for:** The 1.5L EcoBoost can develop a ticking noise at cold startup related to the timing chain. Ford has acknowledged this and released updated parts. The eight-speed automatic occasionally hunts for gears on hilly terrain. Neither issue is a dealbreaker, but they are worth knowing about.

### Kia Telluride

The Telluride has been a massive hit since its 2020 launch, and reliability has been generally positive. It uses a 3.8L Lambda II V6 with an eight-speed automatic, both of which have solid track records in other Hyundai/Kia vehicles.

**Best model years:** 2022 to 2024. The 2020 and 2021 models had more NHTSA complaints (around 400+ for the 2020), many related to electrical issues, windshield cracking, and paint defects. Complaint counts dropped significantly for 2022+.

**Common problems to watch for:** Some owners report a musty smell from the HVAC system, which Kia addressed with an updated cabin air filter and drain hose. The panoramic sunroof on some trims has had isolated reports of cracking. The 3.8L V6 itself has been reliable, with no widespread engine or transmission failures reported.

## SUVs to Think Twice About

Not every popular SUV belongs on a reliability list. Here are some that data suggests you should approach with caution:

**Nissan Pathfinder (2013 to 2020):** The CVT in these models had a high failure rate, with many owners reporting transmission replacement between 60,000 and 100,000 miles. NHTSA received over 1,000 complaints for the 2013 Pathfinder alone, many related to the CVT.

**Jeep Grand Cherokee (2014 to 2021):** The 3.6L Pentastar V6 is decent, but the eight-speed ZF transmission and the overall electrical complexity of these vehicles led to high complaint counts. The 2014 Grand Cherokee has over 2,000 NHTSA complaints. The air suspension on Overland and Summit trims adds another expensive failure point.

**Volkswagen Tiguan (2018+):** The 2.0T EA888 engine is powerful and efficient, but turbo failures, water pump leaks, and timing chain tensioner issues have been documented. Maintenance costs are higher than Japanese competitors, and out-of-warranty repair bills can be steep.

**Chevrolet Equinox (2018 to 2021):** The 1.5L turbo engine in these models has had reports of excessive oil consumption and piston ring issues. NHTSA complaints for the 2018 Equinox exceed 800, with many citing engine problems.

## How to Verify Reliability Before You Buy

No matter which SUV you choose, take these steps:

1. **Check NHTSA complaints** for the specific model year at nhtsa.gov/complaints
2. **Search model-specific forums** for owner-reported long-term issues
3. **Get a pre-purchase inspection** from an independent mechanic (budget $100 to $200)
4. **Pull a vehicle history report** to check for accident damage and service regularity
5. **Check for open recalls** using the VIN at nhtsa.gov/recalls

## The Bottom Line

The most reliable SUVs in 2026 share common traits: naturally aspirated engines (or well-proven turbos), conventional automatic transmissions (or Toyota's hybrid system), and platforms with years of real-world validation. Toyota and Lexus dominate the top tier for good reason, but Honda, Mazda, and Subaru offer excellent alternatives at lower price points.

The key is buying the right model year with the right engine. Even the most reliable nameplate can have problem years. Do your research on the specific configuration before committing.
