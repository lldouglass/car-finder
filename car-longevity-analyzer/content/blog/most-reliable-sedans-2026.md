# Most Reliable Sedans in 2026: Best Cars for Long-Term Ownership

Sedans may not dominate sales charts like SUVs and trucks, but they remain the most practical and affordable vehicles for millions of drivers. They are lighter, more fuel-efficient, and generally cheaper to maintain than their taller counterparts. And when it comes to reliability, the best sedans can deliver 200,000+ miles of trouble-free driving.

This guide ranks the most reliable sedans you can buy in 2026, whether new or used. We base our rankings on NHTSA complaint data, documented powertrain longevity, and real-world owner reports. No marketing fluff, just data.

## Tier 1: Sedans That Refuse to Die

### Toyota Camry (Eighth Generation, 2018 to 2024)

The Camry is the default answer to "what is a reliable car?" and the data backs it up. The eighth-generation Camry uses the Dynamic Force 2.5L four-cylinder (A25A-FKS) or a 3.5L V6 (2GR-FKS), both paired with an eight-speed automatic.

**Best model years:** 2020 to 2024. The 2018 was a first-year redesign, and while reliable overall, NHTSA received around 350 complaints for that year, many related to the transmission occasionally lurching at low speeds. Toyota refined the transmission calibration for 2019, and by 2020, the complaint count dropped to roughly 150. The 2020 to 2024 Camry is about as close to a sure thing as you can get.

**The 2.5L four-cylinder is the reliability pick.** It uses a combination of port and direct fuel injection (D-4S), which prevents the carbon buildup problems that plague many direct-injection-only engines. This engine routinely reaches 250,000 miles with just oil changes, filters, and basic maintenance.

**Common problems to watch for:** The 2018 to 2019 models had reports of a rattling noise from the dashboard on cold mornings, traced to the HVAC blend door actuator. It is a $200 to $400 fix. Some V6 models developed a minor oil seep from the valve covers after 80,000 miles, which is cosmetic unless it worsens. The eight-speed automatic is generally excellent, but a small number of 2018 models needed a valve body replacement.

**What about the 2025+ ninth generation?** The 2025 Camry moved to a mandatory hybrid-only powertrain (2.5L + electric motor). Early reviews are positive and the hybrid system is proven from years of use in other Toyota models. However, long-term data specific to this new platform is still limited.

### Honda Civic (Tenth and Eleventh Generation)

The Civic has been one of America's most popular sedans for decades, and the recent generations deliver strong reliability alongside improved refinement.

**Best model years:** 2019 to 2021 (tenth generation) and 2023 to 2025 (eleventh generation). The tenth-gen Civic settled into a reliability groove by 2019, with NHTSA complaints dropping below 200 for that year. The eleventh-gen 2022 model was a clean-sheet redesign that was well-received, though first-year complaint counts were slightly elevated. By 2023, most issues were sorted.

**Engine choice matters.** The 2.0L naturally aspirated four-cylinder (K20C2 in tenth gen, L15 series in eleventh gen) is the simplest and most reliable option. The 1.5L turbo (L15B7) is more powerful and fuel-efficient but has had documented issues with oil dilution in cold climates, particularly in 2016 to 2018 models. Honda addressed this with software updates and hardware changes by 2019, making the 2019+ turbo models much safer choices.

**Common problems to watch for:** The 2016 to 2018 Civic 1.5T oil dilution issue is the biggest red flag. Gasoline can seep past the piston rings into the crankcase, raising oil levels and thinning the oil. If you buy a 2016 to 2018 Civic turbo, check the oil level and smell it for gasoline. The AC condenser on 2016 to 2020 Civics is prone to developing leaks from road debris; Honda extended the warranty on this part for some model years.

### Toyota Corolla (Twelfth Generation, 2020+)

The Corolla is the best-selling car in history for a reason. The twelfth-generation model uses a 2.0L Dynamic Force four-cylinder (M20A-FKS) with a CVT (in most trims) or a 2.0L with a six-speed manual (in the SE and hatchback).

**Best model years:** 2021 to 2025. The 2020 first-year model had around 300 NHTSA complaints, with some owners reporting CVT hesitation during acceleration from a stop. Toyota refined the CVT programming, and 2021+ models are smoother. Complaint counts for 2021 to 2023 are well under 200 per year.

**Common problems to watch for:** The CVT in the Corolla is not the same type that gives Nissan owners nightmares. Toyota's unit is a belt-type CVT with a physical first gear (Direct Shift CVT), which reduces wear during launch. It is one of the more durable CVTs on the market. The main complaint is that it can feel "rubbery" compared to a traditional automatic. The 2.0L engine uses the same D-4S dual injection system as the Camry, keeping carbon buildup at bay.

**Budget pick:** The eleventh-generation Corolla (2014 to 2019) with the 1.8L 2ZR-FAE and CVT is also extremely reliable. These cars regularly hit 200,000 miles with minimal issues. NHTSA complaint counts are low across the board. They are now affordable enough to be excellent used car values.

### Honda Accord (Tenth Generation, 2018 to 2022)

The tenth-generation Accord is widely considered one of the best midsize sedans ever made, and reliability data supports that assessment. It uses either a 1.5L turbo four-cylinder or a 2.0L turbo four-cylinder, both paired with a CVT (1.5T) or a ten-speed automatic (2.0T).

**Best model years:** 2020 to 2022. The 2018 first-year model had around 400 NHTSA complaints, with many related to the infotainment system freezing and the 1.5T oil dilution issue (similar to the Civic). By 2020, Honda had addressed both issues. The 2.0T with the ten-speed automatic is the enthusiast pick and has proven very reliable.

**Common problems to watch for:** The 1.5T oil dilution issue affects 2018 to 2019 Accords in cold climates, though less severely than in the Civic (the Accord's larger engine bay allows better heat management). The CVT paired with the 1.5T can exhibit a slight hesitation off the line. The 2.0T/ten-speed combo is more responsive and has fewer reported issues.

**What to avoid:** The ninth-generation Accord V6 (2013 to 2017) with the six-speed automatic is a strong car, but some 2013 to 2015 V6 models had transmission shudder issues. The four-cylinder versions of the ninth gen (2.4L K24W with CVT) are generally more reliable.

## Tier 2: Excellent Long-Term Choices

### Mazda3 (Fourth Generation, 2019+)

Mazda has quietly built a reputation for reliability that rivals Toyota and Honda. The fourth-generation Mazda3 uses a 2.5L Skyactiv-G four-cylinder with a six-speed automatic, a simple and proven combination.

**Best model years:** 2021 to 2025. The 2019 first-year model had some infotainment bugs (including CarPlay disconnects and screen flickering) that Mazda resolved through software updates. By 2021, the car was fully sorted. NHTSA complaint counts for the 2021 to 2023 Mazda3 are remarkably low, often under 60 per model year.

**Common problems to watch for:** The direct-injection 2.5L can develop carbon buildup on intake valves over time. An intake walnut blast every 60,000 to 80,000 miles prevents this. The six-speed automatic is conventional and durable. Some owners in cold climates report that the all-wheel-drive system adds a slight vibration during tight turns on dry pavement (a normal characteristic of AWD systems, not a defect).

### Hyundai Sonata (Eighth Generation, 2020 to 2024)

The Sonata has improved dramatically in reliability compared to previous generations. The eighth-generation model uses the Smartstream 2.5L four-cylinder (non-turbo in base and SEL trims) with an eight-speed automatic.

**Best model years:** 2022 to 2024. The 2020 and 2021 models had elevated NHTSA complaints (over 500 for the 2020), with many related to the eight-speed DCT (dual-clutch transmission) in the 1.6T and 2.5T trims. The conventional eight-speed automatic in the 2.5L non-turbo models is more reliable.

**Common problems to watch for:** Avoid the 1.6T and 2.5T Sonata trims if reliability is your priority. The DCT in those models has had reports of jerky low-speed behavior, hesitation, and occasional shuddering. The naturally aspirated 2.5L with the torque-converter eight-speed automatic is the configuration to buy. Also check that all Hyundai engine recalls are up to date; while the Smartstream 2.5L is not affected by the Theta II engine issues, buyer awareness is important.

**What to avoid:** The 2011 to 2014 Sonata with the Theta II 2.4L and 2.0T engines had catastrophic engine failure issues that led to millions of recalls. Do not buy one of these unless the engine has already been replaced under recall.

### Kia K5 (2021+)

The K5 replaced the Optima and shares its platform with the Sonata. The same advice applies: the 2.5L naturally aspirated engine with the eight-speed torque-converter automatic is the reliable configuration.

**Best model years:** 2022 to 2025. The 2021 first-year model had some teething issues with the infotainment system and a recall for a wiring harness that could cause the car to stall. By 2022, these were resolved.

**Common problems to watch for:** Identical to the Sonata: avoid the 1.6T with DCT if reliability is your priority. The GT trim with the 2.5T and DCT is fun to drive but has less proven long-term reliability data.

### Subaru Legacy (Seventh Generation, 2020+)

The Legacy offers standard all-wheel drive, which is a significant advantage for buyers in snowy climates. The 2.5L boxer four-cylinder (FB25) with a CVT (Lineartronic) is the reliability pick.

**Best model years:** 2021 to 2024. The 2020 first-year redesign had around 200 NHTSA complaints, with some related to the infotainment system and starlink connectivity. By 2021, most software issues were patched.

**Common problems to watch for:** The FB25 in older Subarus (2012 to 2016) had excessive oil consumption issues. The revised FB25D (direct injection) in the 2020+ Legacy has largely resolved this. Subaru's CVT has proven more durable than Nissan's, with most owners reporting trouble-free operation past 150,000 miles. However, CVT fluid changes every 30,000 to 60,000 miles are essential for longevity (Subaru recommends 60,000 under normal conditions).

## Tier 3: Solid Choices with Caveats

### Nissan Sentra (Eighth Generation, 2020+)

Nissan's reliability reputation has suffered due to CVT issues in older models, but the 2020+ Sentra shows improvement. It uses a 2.0L four-cylinder with a redesigned CVT (Xtronic) that is more durable than the unit in previous generations.

**Best model years:** 2022 to 2025. The 2020 and 2021 models had more complaints, but the 2022+ models have been relatively clean. The Sentra is a budget sedan, so expectations should be calibrated accordingly, but it is a genuine improvement over the problem-plagued 2013 to 2019 generation.

**Common problems to watch for:** The CVT is always the concern with Nissan. While the new unit is better, long-term data past 100,000 miles is still limited. Change the CVT fluid every 30,000 miles regardless of what the manual says. Some owners report that the continuously variable transmission can feel sluggish under hard acceleration, which is a characteristic rather than a defect.

### Volkswagen Jetta (Seventh Generation, 2019+)

The Jetta uses the 1.5L EA211 TSI (2024+) or 1.4L EA211 TSI (2019 to 2023) with an eight-speed automatic. VW's reliability has improved significantly in recent years, and the Jetta is one of their more dependable models.

**Best model years:** 2022 to 2025. The 2019 to 2021 models had reports of infotainment glitches and some recalls related to the fuel system. By 2022, VW had stabilized the platform. The 1.4T/1.5T engines are small-displacement turbos, but they are mature designs with a solid track record in the European market.

**Common problems to watch for:** VW's eight-speed automatic (Aisin-sourced) is generally reliable, but it requires regular fluid changes that many owners skip. Turbo failure at high mileage (150,000+) is a possibility. Water pump failures have been documented on some EA211 engines around 60,000 to 80,000 miles, costing $500 to $800 to replace.

## Sedans to Think Twice About

**Nissan Altima (2013 to 2018):** The CVT in these models has an extremely high failure rate. NHTSA received over 2,500 complaints for the 2013 Altima, with transmission failure being the dominant theme. Many owners report CVT replacement at 60,000 to 90,000 miles.

**Chevrolet Malibu (2016 to 2024):** The 1.5L turbo engine has had reports of excessive oil consumption, turbo failure, and transmission shudder with the CVT. NHTSA complaints for the 2016 and 2017 Malibu are high. The 2024 model year was the last for the Malibu.

**Kia Forte (2014 to 2018):** These models used earlier Hyundai/Kia engines that, while not as problematic as the Theta II, had higher complaint rates than competitors. The 2019+ Forte with the Smartstream 2.0L is a better choice.

## The 200,000-Mile Sedan Checklist

If your goal is to drive a sedan past 200,000 miles, follow these guidelines:

1. **Change oil every 5,000 miles** with the manufacturer-recommended weight (usually 0W-20 for modern sedans)
2. **Transmission fluid** every 30,000 to 60,000 miles, even if the manual says "lifetime fill"
3. **Coolant flush** every 60,000 to 100,000 miles
4. **Spark plugs** at 60,000 to 100,000 miles depending on the engine
5. **Timing belt** (if applicable) at the manufacturer-recommended interval; skipping this can destroy the engine
6. **Brake fluid flush** every 2 to 3 years to prevent internal corrosion

Most sedan engines that fail prematurely do so because of neglected maintenance, not inherent design flaws. A well-maintained Camry, Civic, or Corolla will almost certainly outlast a neglected one by 100,000 miles or more.

## The Bottom Line

The most reliable sedans in 2026 are dominated by Japanese automakers, and that is not a coincidence. Toyota, Honda, and Mazda consistently prioritize powertrain simplicity and durability. The Camry and Corolla lead the pack, but the Civic, Accord, and Mazda3 are excellent alternatives that offer more driving engagement.

Korean sedans from Hyundai and Kia have improved dramatically, but you need to be selective about the engine and transmission configuration. Stick with naturally aspirated engines paired with conventional automatic transmissions for the best long-term reliability outcomes.
