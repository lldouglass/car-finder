# Most Reliable Trucks in 2026: Which Pickups Last Longest

Trucks are expected to work hard, tow heavy loads, and last a long time. But not every pickup delivers on that promise equally. Some trucks routinely cross 250,000 miles while still earning their keep, while others develop expensive powertrain problems well before 150,000 miles.

This guide ranks the most reliable trucks in 2026 using NHTSA complaint data, owner longevity reports, and known powertrain track records. We focus on which specific engines and transmissions have proven themselves, because in the truck world, the engine option you choose matters more than the badge on the tailgate.

## Why Engine Choice Matters More Than Brand

A Ford F-150 can be incredibly reliable or a maintenance headache depending on the engine. A Ram 1500 with the 5.7L Hemi is a different ownership experience than one with the 3.0L EcoDiesel. When shopping for a reliable truck, always research the specific powertrain, not just the model name.

## Tier 1: Trucks That Go the Distance

### Toyota Tacoma (Third Generation, 2016 to 2023)

The Tacoma is the gold standard for midsize truck reliability. The third-generation model used two engine options: a 2.7L four-cylinder (2TR-FE) and a 3.5L V6 (2GR-FKS). Both are naturally aspirated and proven.

**Best model years:** 2018 to 2023. The 2016 and 2017 models had higher NHTSA complaint counts (over 500 for the 2016), with many owners reporting transmission hesitation and rough shifting on the six-speed automatic. Toyota issued software updates and revised the transmission calibration for 2018+, significantly improving shift quality.

**The V6 is the better choice.** The 3.5L V6 makes enough power for towing and highway merging without being stressed. It pairs with either a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic. Both transmissions are durable. The manual is essentially bulletproof; the automatic is smooth after the 2018 recalibration.

**Common problems to watch for:** Some 2016 to 2019 Tacomas developed a "Tacoma Transmission Tick," a clicking noise from the automatic transmission at low speeds. It is a known characteristic rather than a failure point, but it annoys some owners. The rear leaf springs on TRD Off-Road models can develop a squeak. The 2016 to 2017 models also had reports of the truck surging forward during low-speed braking; Toyota addressed this with a TSB.

**What about the 2024+ fourth generation?** The new Tacoma uses a 2.4L turbocharged four-cylinder (shared with the Highlander and Crown). Early reviews are positive, but there is not enough long-term data to rank it yet. If you want proven reliability, the 2018 to 2023 V6 is the safer bet.

### Toyota Tundra (Second Generation, 2007 to 2021)

The second-generation Tundra is a full-size truck that has earned a reputation for extreme longevity. The 5.7L 3UR-FE V8, available from 2007 to 2021, is one of the most durable truck engines ever produced. Tundras with 300,000+ miles on the original engine and transmission are not uncommon.

**Best model years:** 2014 to 2021. The 2014 refresh brought a modernized interior, improved infotainment, and refined suspension tuning. NHTSA complaints for 2014 to 2021 models are consistently low, with most years averaging under 200 complaints. The 2007 to 2013 models are also reliable, but the interior feels dated and the 4.6L V8 (1UR-FE) option is adequate rather than impressive.

**Common problems to watch for:** The secondary air injection system on 2007 to 2015 Tundras can fail, triggering a check engine light. The repair costs $1,500 to $2,500 at a dealer. This is an emissions system issue, not an engine durability concern, but it is the most commonly reported Tundra problem. The exhaust manifold bolts on the 5.7L can corrode and break in rust belt states. The truck's fuel economy (13 to 17 MPG) is poor compared to competitors, which is a running cost issue rather than a reliability one.

**What to avoid:** The 2022+ third-generation Tundra switched to a twin-turbo 3.4L V6 (V35A-FTS). While it makes good power and better fuel economy, the twin-turbo setup is more complex. Early 2022 models had some reports of turbo-related issues and software glitches. Long-term data is still being established.

### Honda Ridgeline

The Ridgeline is not a traditional body-on-frame truck, but its unibody construction and Honda engineering make it one of the most reliable pickups you can buy. The second-generation Ridgeline (2017+) uses the 3.5L J35Y6 V6 with a nine-speed automatic (2017 to 2020) or ten-speed automatic (2021+).

**Best model years:** 2019 to 2024. The 2017 and 2018 models had some reports of the nine-speed automatic being slow to downshift and occasionally hunting for gears. Honda refined the transmission programming for 2019, and complaints dropped. NHTSA data shows the 2019 and 2020 Ridgeline with roughly 80 to 100 complaints each, which is very low.

**Common problems to watch for:** The 2017 to 2020 nine-speed automatic can develop a shudder under light acceleration, similar to issues reported in other Honda/Acura vehicles using the ZF-sourced nine-speed. A transmission fluid change with Honda-specific DW-1 fluid often resolves this. The truck bed, while innovative (dual-action tailgate, in-bed trunk), is smaller than competitors, which is a utility limitation rather than a reliability issue.

**Not for heavy towing:** The Ridgeline's 5,000-pound tow rating is adequate for small trailers but well below what full-size trucks offer. If you tow frequently over 5,000 pounds, look at the Tundra or F-150 instead.

## Tier 2: Reliable with the Right Configuration

### Ford F-150 (Thirteenth/Fourteenth Generation)

The F-150 is America's best-selling vehicle, and it can be very reliable if you choose the right engine. Ford has offered numerous powertrains, and they are not all equal.

**Best engine choice: 5.0L Coyote V8 (2018+).** The naturally aspirated 5.0L is the simplest and most proven engine in the current F-150 lineup. It does not have turbochargers, intercoolers, or high-pressure fuel injection systems to fail. It pairs with a ten-speed automatic that, after initial calibration issues in 2017, has proven to be a durable transmission. The 2018 to 2020 F-150 with the 5.0L is the sweet spot for reliability buyers.

**Second choice: 3.5L EcoBoost V6 (second generation, 2017+).** The second-gen 3.5L EcoBoost fixed the timing chain and intercooler condensation issues that plagued the first generation (2011 to 2016). It is powerful, efficient, and generally reliable past 150,000 miles. However, turbo replacements at high mileage ($2,000 to $3,000) are a possibility that V8 owners never face.

**Common problems to watch for:** The ten-speed automatic in 2017 to 2019 F-150s had widespread complaints about harsh shifting, gear hunting, and clunking during low-speed maneuvers. Ford released multiple TSBs and software updates. Make sure any used F-150 from these years has the latest transmission software. The 2021+ F-150 largely resolved these shift quality issues from the factory.

**What to avoid:** The 2.7L EcoBoost V6, while fuel-efficient, has had reports of carbon buildup on intake valves and some coolant intrusion issues on early models. It is not unreliable, but the 5.0L and 3.5L are safer long-term bets. Also avoid the first-generation 3.5L EcoBoost (2011 to 2016) if reliability is your priority; the timing chain and cam phaser issues are well documented.

### Chevrolet Silverado 1500 / GMC Sierra 1500

The Silverado and Sierra are mechanically identical twins, so reliability data applies to both. GM's truck reliability depends heavily on the engine generation.

**Best engine choice: 5.3L L83/L84 V8 with the six-speed automatic (2014 to 2018).** This is the proven combination. The 5.3L V8 with Active Fuel Management (AFM, also called Dynamic Fuel Management or DFM in later models) has been in production for decades. The six-speed 6L80 transmission is well understood and relatively inexpensive to service.

**Best model years:** 2016 to 2018 (K2XX platform). These years benefit from mid-cycle improvements while using the proven 5.3L/6-speed combo. NHTSA complaints are moderate but manageable.

**Common problems to watch for:** The AFM (cylinder deactivation) system is the Silverado's Achilles' heel. It can cause excessive oil consumption, lifter failures, and collapsed lifters, particularly on 2014 to 2020 models. Lifter replacement is a $3,000 to $5,000 repair. Many owners install AFM delete kits to prevent this issue. The 2019+ T1XX platform added a ten-speed automatic that has had some reports of harsh shifting and a "clunk" when shifting from reverse to drive.

**What to avoid:** The 2019+ Silverado with the 2.7L turbo four-cylinder (L3B) is primarily aimed at fleet buyers. While it offers decent power, long-term data on this engine in a full-size truck is limited. The 3.0L Duramax inline-six diesel (LM2) in the Silverado/Sierra has had significant reliability concerns, including fuel injector failures, DPF regeneration issues, and a class-action lawsuit related to engine defects. Avoid the diesel unless you have a very specific need for it.

### Ram 1500 (Fifth Generation, 2019+)

The Ram 1500 is arguably the most refined full-size truck on sale, with its coil-spring rear suspension delivering a ride quality that rivals many SUVs. Reliability has been improving, though Stellantis products still carry some stigma.

**Best engine choice: 5.7L Hemi V8 with the eight-speed ZF automatic.** The Hemi has been in Ram trucks since 2003, and the current version is a known quantity. It is powerful, reasonably fuel-efficient with the eTorque mild-hybrid system, and generally durable past 200,000 miles. The ZF eight-speed automatic is smooth and reliable.

**Best model years:** 2021 to 2024. The 2019 and 2020 models had higher NHTSA complaint counts (over 1,000 for the 2019), with many related to electrical issues, eTorque system glitches, and a recall for the backup camera display. By 2021, most of these issues were resolved.

**Common problems to watch for:** The Hemi's MDS (Multi-Displacement System, similar to GM's AFM) can cause lifter tick and, in rare cases, lifter failure. This is less common than on the GM 5.3L but still worth monitoring. The eTorque 48V mild-hybrid battery can fail, costing $500 to $1,000 to replace. The air suspension on Rebel and Limited trims adds a potential failure point after 80,000 to 100,000 miles.

**What to avoid:** The 3.0L EcoDiesel V6 (VM Motori) in the Ram 1500 has had significant reliability issues across all generations. Common problems include EGR cooler failures, turbo failures, and fuel system contamination. The engine was the subject of an emissions cheating settlement with the EPA. If you want diesel fuel economy, the Ram 1500 is not the place to find reliable diesel power.

## Tier 3: Niche Picks with Good Data

### Nissan Frontier (Third Generation, 2022+)

After running the second-generation Frontier virtually unchanged from 2005 to 2021 (which, ironically, made it extremely well understood and reliable), Nissan finally redesigned the Frontier for 2022. The new model uses a 3.8L V6 (VQ38DD) with a nine-speed automatic.

**Best model years:** 2023 to 2025. The 2022 first-year model had some infotainment bugs and minor trim rattles. By 2023, Nissan sorted out most quality issues. The 3.8L V6 is a naturally aspirated engine with direct injection, and early reliability data is positive.

**Common problems to watch for:** The nine-speed automatic can exhibit a slight delay when shifting from park to drive. Some owners report wind noise around the mirrors at highway speeds. These are minor complaints, and the overall NHTSA complaint count for the 2022 to 2023 Frontier is low.

**Legacy pick:** The 2005 to 2021 Frontier with the 4.0L VQ40DE V6 is a known quantity. That engine can easily reach 250,000 miles. If you find a well-maintained second-gen Frontier, it remains an excellent reliable truck choice despite its age.

### Chevrolet Colorado / GMC Canyon (Third Generation, 2023+)

The redesigned Colorado and Canyon use a 2.7L turbo four-cylinder (L3B) with an eight-speed automatic. While the 2.7L turbo is still relatively new, it has accumulated enough data in the full-size Silverado to establish a baseline.

**Best model years:** 2024 to 2025. The 2023 first-year models had reports of infotainment freezing, adaptive cruise control glitches, and some interior trim issues. GM addressed most of these through software updates and running changes for 2024.

**Common problems to watch for:** The 2.7L turbo requires premium fuel for maximum performance (though it will run on regular with reduced output). The turbo adds a component that will eventually need replacement at high mileage. Carbon buildup on direct-injection intake valves is a long-term concern that all DI engines face.

## Trucks to Approach with Caution

**Nissan Titan (2016+):** The 5.6L Endurance V8 is decent, but the Titan has never sold well, which means fewer parts availability and lower resale value. NHTSA complaints for the 2017 Titan are surprisingly high (over 400), with many related to transmission issues and electrical problems.

**Ford Ranger (2019 to 2023, North American):** The 2.3L EcoBoost four-cylinder with the ten-speed automatic had reports of transmission shudder, rough shifting, and occasional stalling. The 2024+ next-gen Ranger is too new for long-term data.

**Jeep Gladiator:** It shares the Wrangler's platform, which means it also shares the Wrangler's issues: the 3.6L Pentastar V6 can develop oil filter housing leaks, the eight-speed automatic can shift roughly, and the body-on-frame construction with removable panels creates more opportunities for water leaks and wind noise. It is a lifestyle vehicle more than a reliable workhorse.

## Tips for Buying a Reliable Truck

1. **Choose the simplest powertrain available.** Naturally aspirated engines with conventional automatic transmissions have the best long-term track records.
2. **Check towing history.** Trucks that have towed near their maximum capacity regularly will have more transmission and drivetrain wear.
3. **Inspect the frame.** Body-on-frame trucks in rust belt states can develop frame rust that is expensive or impossible to repair. Toyota Tacomas (2005 to 2015) had a frame recall for exactly this issue.
4. **Budget for maintenance.** Even reliable trucks need brake pads, tires (truck tires are expensive), and fluid changes. A well-maintained truck with 150,000 miles is better than a neglected truck with 80,000 miles.
5. **Check NHTSA complaints** for the exact model year and engine at nhtsa.gov/complaints.

## The Bottom Line

The most reliable trucks in 2026 are the ones with proven, naturally aspirated engines and conventional transmissions. The Toyota Tacoma V6 and Toyota Tundra 5.7L V8 lead the pack, but the Ford F-150 5.0L V8 and Ram 1500 5.7L Hemi are also strong choices when you pick the right model year.

The biggest reliability risk in modern trucks is not the engine or transmission itself; it is the auxiliary systems: cylinder deactivation, turbocharging, mild-hybrid electronics, and air suspension. The more complexity you add, the more potential failure points you introduce. Choose wisely.
