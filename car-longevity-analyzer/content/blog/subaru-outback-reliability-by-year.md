# Subaru Outback Reliability by Year: Best and Worst Model Years to Buy

Not all Subaru Outbacks are created equal. The nameplate has been around since 1995, and in that time Subaru has used at least four different engine families, two transmission types, and gone through six generations with wildly different reliability profiles. Buying a 2005 Outback and a 2015 Outback are fundamentally different experiences in terms of what can go wrong and how much it will cost you.

This guide breaks down every Outback generation year by year so you can see exactly which models to target and which to walk away from. If you want the quick answer: the [general Outback longevity analysis](/blog/how-long-does-subaru-outback-last) covers expected lifespan and common issues. This article goes deeper into specific model years.

## Quick Reference: Best and Worst Years at a Glance

**Best years to buy used:**
- 2013-2014 (first FB25 years with kinks worked out, no CVT issues yet)
- 2018-2019 (refined 5th gen, reliable CVT calibration, pre-turbo)
- 2022-2024 (6th gen with improved CVT and turbo option)

**Worst years to avoid:**
- 2001-2004 (head gasket failures guaranteed around 100k miles)
- 2005 (worst head gasket year + early XT turbo oil issues)
- 2010-2011 (last EJ25 years, oil consumption + gasket problems still present)
- 2015-2016 (early CVT calibration issues, excessive oil consumption complaints)

## First Generation (1995-1999): The Original Wagon

The original Outback was essentially a raised Legacy wagon with roof rails and some body cladding. These are old enough now that condition matters more than model year.

**1995-1997:**
- Engine: EJ25 2.5L boxer four
- Transmission: 4-speed automatic or 5-speed manual
- Reliability: Head gaskets are the defining issue. External leaks typically start between 80,000-120,000 miles
- At this age (27-31 years old), rust is the real killer. Check subframes, brake lines, and rocker panels
- If the head gaskets have been replaced and rust is minimal, these can still run to 250,000 miles

**1998-1999:**
- Same powertrain as 1995-1997
- Added EJ22 2.2L option in some markets (more reliable than the 2.5L, no head gasket issues)
- If you find a 2.2L, it is the better buy. The engine is nearly bulletproof but makes less power
- Price range for a clean example: $2,000-$4,500

**Overall first gen verdict:** Only buy if head gaskets have been replaced and documented, or if you can get a 2.2L. Not worth the gamble otherwise at this age.

## Second Generation (2000-2004): The Head Gasket Generation

This is the generation that earned Subaru its head gasket reputation. Every single 2.5L engine from this era will develop head gasket leaks. The question is not if, but when and whether the previous owner already dealt with it.

**2000-2002:**
- The EJ251/EJ253 2.5L engine uses composite (graphite) head gaskets that fail consistently between 80,000-150,000 miles
- External leaks (oil and coolant seeping from the block-to-head mating surface) are the typical failure mode
- Repair cost: $1,500-$2,500 at an independent shop
- The H6 3.0L option (introduced in the L.L. Bean edition) does NOT have this problem. The EZ30 is a solid engine if you can find one
- Automatic transmissions from this era are 4-speed units that are generally reliable

**2003-2004:**
- Same EJ253 engine, same head gasket problem
- Subaru made minor revisions to the gasket material but it did not solve the core issue
- The 2004 model got a light refresh but mechanically identical
- Turbo XT model available with EJ255: more power but adds turbo-specific maintenance (oil changes every 3,000-4,000 miles, timing belt at 105k)

**Overall second gen verdict:** Avoid unless the car comes with documented head gasket replacement using MLS (multi-layer steel) gaskets. If someone already did the job properly, the engine is good for another 100,000+ miles. The 3.0L H6 models are the hidden gems.

## Third Generation (2005-2009): Peak Problems

The third generation brought a fresh design but carried forward the same problematic engines.

**2005:**
- The worst model year in Outback history
- EJ253 head gasket issues continue at the same rate
- New XT turbo models had additional problems: oil starvation during hard cornering, turbo failure from oil contamination
- Automatic transmission issues (torque converter shudder) appeared more frequently
- Avoid this year entirely unless priced very cheaply with full service records

**2006-2007:**
- Subaru revised the head gasket material again, slightly reducing failure rates
- Still the EJ253, still susceptible. Just marginally better odds
- CVT not yet introduced; still using traditional 4-speed or 5-speed auto
- These are reasonable buys only at low prices ($3,000-$5,000) with head gasket work already done

**2008-2009:**
- The EJ253 continues unchanged
- By this point in the generation, most known issues had workarounds
- 2009 models are the last year of the third gen and benefit from accumulated refinements
- A 2009 with head gaskets already replaced is one of the more livable options from this era
- The 3.0R (H6 engine) version is again the better choice when available

**Overall third gen verdict:** 2005 is the worst year to buy. 2008-2009 are acceptable if priced right and the head gasket job is done. The H6 remains the reliability leader.

## Fourth Generation (2010-2014): The Transition

This generation marks the shift from the problematic EJ25 to the better FB25 engine, but the transition was not clean.

**2010-2011:**
- Still using the EJ253 2.5L with the head gasket vulnerability
- New body style, same old engine problems
- Oil consumption complaints increased: some owners reported 1 quart every 1,000-2,000 miles
- CVT introduced in 2010 as the sole transmission option (no more traditional automatic)
- Early CVT units had occasional juddering and hesitation issues
- These are transition years with old problems plus new transmission uncertainty. Not recommended.

**2012:**
- **The FB25 engine debuts.** This is the big change
- Multi-layer steel head gaskets from the factory. The chronic head gasket failure problem is essentially eliminated
- New timing chain (instead of timing belt), saving $800+ in maintenance at 105k miles
- CVT continues but with improved calibration
- Oil consumption can still be an issue: some FB25 engines from 2012-2014 consumed excessive oil
- A good year overall, but the 2012 is the first FB25 year and carries typical first-year-of-new-engine risk

**2013-2014:**
- FB25 engine with refinements to address early oil consumption issues
- CVT calibration improved with better software tuning
- EyeSight driver assist system became available (a strong resale value feature)
- These are the sweet spot years for the fourth generation
- Price range: $8,000-$14,000 depending on mileage and EyeSight trim
- Expected lifespan: 200,000-250,000 miles with proper maintenance

**Overall fourth gen verdict:** Skip 2010-2011 (old engine in new body). 2012 is OK. 2013-2014 are the best buys.

## Fifth Generation (2015-2019): Refined but Not Perfect

The fifth generation brought more interior refinement and better tech, but introduced new issues.

**2015-2016:**
- FB25 engine continues
- **Oil consumption problems resurfaced.** Subaru faced a class-action lawsuit over excessive oil consumption in 2012-2017 model years. The 2015-2016 models were among the worst affected
- CVT reliability was inconsistent. Some owners reported CVT failure around 100,000 miles ($6,000-$8,000 repair)
- Subaru extended the CVT warranty to 100,000 miles on affected vehicles
- These years are fine if bought with the extended warranty or if the CVT has already been replaced/serviced

**2017:**
- Subaru revised the piston ring design to address oil consumption, and it largely worked
- CVT received improved fluid and updated valve body
- This is the year where the fifth gen starts to become a solid buy
- Price range: $12,000-$17,000

**2018-2019:**
- The best years of the fifth generation
- Oil consumption issues mostly resolved
- CVT reliability improved significantly
- EyeSight became standard on most trims
- Ride quality, noise insulation, and interior quality all noticeably better than early fifth-gen models
- 2019 is the final year before the generation change, meaning all the kinks are worked out
- Price range: $15,000-$22,000

**Overall fifth gen verdict:** Avoid 2015-2016 unless cheap. 2017 is acceptable. 2018-2019 are the sweet spot.

## Sixth Generation (2020-Present): The Modern Outback

The current generation is larger, more refined, and added a turbo option.

**2020-2021:**
- New platform (Subaru Global Platform) with significantly improved rigidity and safety
- FA24 2.4L turbocharged engine available (Onyx and Touring XT trims). This is an excellent engine with no known major issues
- FB25 continues as the base engine
- CVT is Subaru's latest revision with improved chain design
- Infotainment system had bugs in 2020 (screen freezes, unresponsive touch), mostly resolved via updates
- 2020 is a first-year model, and some owners reported minor electrical gremlins

**2022-2024:**
- Refinements to infotainment system
- The FA24 turbo is available on more trims
- CVT has proven reliable through multiple model years now
- Wilderness trim added (lifted suspension, more rugged, 8.7" ground clearance)
- These are solid buys as CPO or low-mileage used
- Price range: $22,000-$32,000

**Overall sixth gen verdict:** All years are good. 2022+ is the best if budget allows. The turbo FA24 models are the most fun to drive and have proven reliable.

## Maintenance Tips for Any Outback

Regardless of year, these habits maximize Outback lifespan:

1. **Change oil every 5,000 miles** (3,000-4,000 for turbo models). The boxer engine layout makes oil quality critical
2. **Check oil level monthly.** Especially on 2012-2017 FB25 models. Do not let it run low
3. **Replace the timing belt at 105,000 miles** on EJ25 engines (pre-2012). The FB25 has a chain that does not need replacement
4. **Flush CVT fluid every 30,000-50,000 miles.** Subaru says "lifetime fluid," but independent mechanics universally disagree. Fresh fluid extends CVT life significantly
5. **Watch for rust** on models older than 10 years, especially in northern climates. Subaru's rustproofing improved after 2015 but is still not as good as Toyota
6. **Budget for all-wheel-drive tire maintenance.** All four tires must match in tread depth. Running mismatched tires damages the center differential

## Which Year Should You Buy?

**Budget under $8,000:** Look for a 2013-2014 with documented maintenance and no oil consumption issues. Check oil level during the test drive.

**Budget $10,000-$18,000:** Target 2018-2019 fifth gen. Best balance of modern features, reliability, and value. EyeSight models hold value better.

**Budget $20,000-$30,000:** 2022-2024 sixth gen, ideally the turbo XT trim. Reliable, capable, and will hold value well.

**Avoid regardless of price:** 2001-2005 (head gasket gamble), 2010-2011 (old engine in new body), 2015-2016 (oil consumption and CVT uncertainty).
