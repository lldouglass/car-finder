## High-Mileage Vehicle Maintenance Overview

Once your vehicle reaches 150,000+ miles, it transitions from standard maintenance to high-mileage care requiring more frequent service, preventive replacements, and careful monitoring. High-mileage vehicles need enhanced attention to prevent small problems from becoming expensive failures while maximizing remaining service life.

High-mileage maintenance focuses on three key principles: **prevention over repair**, **frequent monitoring**, and **proactive replacement** of wear items before they fail catastrophically. With the right approach, many vehicles can reliably serve well beyond 200,000-300,000 miles.
