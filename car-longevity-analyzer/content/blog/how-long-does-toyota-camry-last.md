# How Long Does a Toyota Camry Last?

If you want a sedan that'll go the distance, the Toyota Camry is about as close to a sure bet as you'll get. These cars regularly reach 300,000+ miles still running strong, and it's not uncommon at all.

A well-maintained Toyota Camry will typically last 250,000 to 300,000 miles, with many examples pushing well beyond that. Owner reports show Camrys from the early 2000s still running at 400,000+ miles. But not all Camry years are created equal, and knowing which generations to target (and which to avoid) can save you thousands.

## Generation Breakdown: The Good, The Great, and The Oil Burners

### 2012-2017 Generation: The Sweet Spot

This is the generation you want. The 2012 redesign brought the 2AR-FE 2.5L four-cylinder engine, which Toyota had finally perfected by this point. These cars routinely hit 250,000-300,000 miles with basic maintenance.

**The 2AR-FE Engine Reality**

- **2012-2014**: Early production had oil consumption issues. Some burn a quart every 1,000 miles, which Toyota eventually addressed through a Technical Service Bulletin (TSB)
- **2015-2017**: The oil consumption problem was largely resolved. These are the absolute sweet spot years
- **Real-world maintenance costs**: Expect about $400-600 annually in routine maintenance (oil changes, filters, brake pads)

The six-speed automatic transmission in these years is bulletproof. These transmissions hold up remarkably well past 200,000+ miles. Change the fluid every 60,000 miles (don't believe the "lifetime fluid" marketing) and these transmissions will outlast the car.

### 2007-2009 Generation: Avoid Like the Plague

Here's where things get ugly. The 2AZ-FE 2.4L engine in these years has a design flaw that causes excessive oil consumption. Toyota issued a class-action settlement because so many owners experienced engines burning through a quart of oil every 1,000-2,000 miles.

**Common problems reported:**
- Oil consumption starting around 80,000-100,000 miles
- Piston ring failures
- Carbon buildup in the combustion chambers
- VVT-i actuator failures (common around 120,000 miles)

If you're looking at a 2007-2009 Camry, budget an extra $2,000-3,000 for potential engine work. The ones that made it past 150,000 miles without major oil consumption might be okay, but it's a gamble.

### 2018+ Generation: Too New to Judge, But Promising

The latest generation switched to Toyota's Dynamic Force 2.5L engine (A25A-FKS), which uses a combination of direct and port injection. On paper, it looks excellent, but we won't know the true long-term reliability for another 5-7 years.

Early indicators are positive: no pattern failures have emerged yet, and the engines seem to run clean thanks to the dual injection system preventing carbon buildup. The eight-speed automatic is also well-regarded.

## The 2012-2017 Maintenance Bible

Since these are the most recommended years, here's your roadmap to 300,000+ miles:

**Every 5,000 Miles (Not 10,000)**
- Oil and filter change with full synthetic oil
- Toyota recommends 10,000-mile intervals, but many engines develop sludge buildup following that schedule
- Use 0W-20 full synthetic; brands matter less than change frequency

**Every 30,000 Miles**
- Air filter replacement
- Cabin filter replacement
- Brake fluid check
- Coolant system inspection

**Every 60,000 Miles**
- Transmission fluid change (use genuine Toyota WS fluid)
- Spark plugs (the 2AR-FE uses iridium plugs that actually do last this long)
- Brake fluid flush
- Serpentine belt inspection

**Every 100,000 Miles**
- Timing chain inspection (these engines use chains, not belts)
- Water pump inspection
- Replace all fluids
- Suspension component inspection

**The $1,200 Reality Check**

Around 120,000-150,000 miles, budget about $1,200 for the "high-mileage service": new struts ($600), brake pads and rotors front and rear ($400), and various rubber components ($200). This isn't a failure; it's just normal wear.

## Real Ownership Costs: What Nobody Tells You

**Years 0-100,000 Miles**
- Annual maintenance: $400-600
- Major unexpected repairs: Minimal (maybe $500-1,000 total)
- Total cost of ownership: Under $5,000

**Years 100,000-200,000 Miles**
- Annual maintenance: $600-900
- Major repairs: Struts, brakes, maybe an alternator or starter
- Budget: $1,000-1,500 annually

**Years 200,000+ Miles**
- Annual maintenance: $800-1,200
- Major repairs become more common: AC compressor, wheel bearings, etc.
- Budget: $1,500-2,500 annually

The sweet spot for selling is typically around 180,000-220,000 miles. You'll have gotten the best reliability years while avoiding most major age-related repairs.

## Red Flags When Shopping for Used Camrys

**2007-2009 Models: Oil Consumption Test**
If you're considering one despite the warnings above, do this: Check the oil level, drive it 500 miles, then check again. If it's down more than half a quart, walk away.

**Any Model: Maintenance Records**
No maintenance records? That's a hard pass. These engines need regular oil changes to hit high mileage. A $12,000 Camry with no service history isn't a deal; it's a future $4,000 engine replacement.

**Timing Chain Noise**
On startup, listen for rattling from the engine bay. A rattling timing chain means you're looking at $1,500-2,500 in repairs.

## How Camrys Actually Die

Based on owner reports and repair data, here's what typically kills them:

**Rust (Northern Cars)**
- Road salt eats the subframe and body panels
- Starts around 150,000-200,000 miles in salt states
- Not economical to repair once it's severe

**Transmission Failure (Neglected Maintenance)**
- Usually happens after 200,000+ miles if fluid was never changed
- Rebuild costs $3,000-4,000

**Engine Sludge (Poor Oil Change History)**
- Clogs oil passages, starves bearings
- More common in 10,000-mile oil change followers

**Death by a Thousand Cuts**
- After 250,000+ miles, multiple age-related failures happen simultaneously
- AC compressor, power steering pump, suspension components all failing within 6 months
- Repair costs exceed vehicle value

## The 300,000-Mile Club: What It Takes

Owner reports consistently show what 300,000+ mile Camrys have in common:

**Religious Maintenance**
- Oil changes every 5,000 miles, no exceptions
- Transmission fluid changed every 60,000 miles
- Coolant system maintained properly

**Highway Miles**
- Cars driven primarily on highways last longer than city-driven ones
- Highway driving means less wear on brakes and transmission

**Garaged Storage**
- Protection from UV and temperature extremes extends everything: paint, interior, rubber seals

**Proactive Repairs**
- Owners who fix small problems before they become big ones
- Address check engine lights promptly
- Replace worn suspension components before they damage other parts

## Camry vs. the Competition

**Honda Accord**: Historically very close to Camry reliability, but recent CVT transmission issues in some models give the edge to Camry
**Nissan Altima**: CVT transmission problems make this a poor long-term choice
**Ford Fusion**: Decent cars, but parts availability and long-term reliability don't match Toyota
**Chevrolet Malibu**: Improving, but still not in the same league for longevity

For quick reliability comparisons on specific model years, tools like carlifespancheck.com can help you check NHTSA complaint data and known issues before you buy.

## When to Walk Away vs. Keep Repairing

**Keep repairing if:**
- Annual repair costs under $1,500
- Engine and transmission still strong
- Body/frame in good condition
- You know the maintenance history

**Time to sell when:**
- Repair costs exceed 50% of vehicle value two years running
- Multiple major systems failing simultaneously
- Rust compromising structural integrity
- Transmission or engine rebuild needed

## The Bottom Line

A 2015-2017 Camry with maintenance records is one of the best used car investments you can make. Expect 250,000-300,000 miles of reliable service with reasonable maintenance costs. Avoid the 2007-2009 oil burners, and don't buy anything without service records.

The data consistently points to one conclusion: the 2012+ Camry is one of the best used car values available. They're boring, reliable, and they'll still be running long after more exciting cars have been towed to the junkyard.

The key is finding one that's been maintained properly and buying it before major age-related repairs start hitting. Do that, and you'll join the ranks of satisfied Camry owners who measure their car's life in decades, not years.
