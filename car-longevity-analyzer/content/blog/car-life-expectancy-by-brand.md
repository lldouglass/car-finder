When shopping for a reliable vehicle, brand reputation matters more than you might think. While individual models vary, certain manufacturers have consistently produced vehicles that last 200,000, 300,000, or even 500,000+ miles with proper maintenance.

Our analysis combines NHTSA complaint data, Consumer Reports reliability surveys, and real-world owner experiences to rank every major automotive brand by life expectancy.
