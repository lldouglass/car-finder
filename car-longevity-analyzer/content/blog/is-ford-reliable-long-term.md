## Ford's 2026 Reliability Reality: A Mixed Picture

Ford is considered a moderately reliable brand for long-term ownership in 2026, with significant variation by model line. While Ford ranks 14th out of 26 brands in Consumer Reports reliability rankings, this middle-tier position masks dramatic differences between individual models. The Ford Maverick and Bronco Sport represent reliability success stories, while the Explorer and discontinued Edge remain problematic for long-term ownership.

Ford's transformation from its troubled 2008-2015 period shows genuine improvement in specific segments, particularly trucks and small SUVs. However, the brand still struggles with complex three-row SUVs and certain turbocharged engines, making model-specific research essential for potential buyers.
