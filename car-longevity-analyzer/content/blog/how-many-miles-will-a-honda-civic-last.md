## How Many Miles Will a Honda Civic Last?

A well-maintained Honda Civic typically lasts 250,000 to 300,000 miles, with many examples exceeding 350,000 miles. According to iSeeCars longevity data, 2.3% of Honda Civics reach 300,000+ miles, ranking it among the top 10 longest-lasting vehicles. The Civic's exceptional reliability stems from Honda's conservative engineering, proven powertrains, and relatively simple construction that prioritizes durability over cutting-edge features.

Different Civic generations show varying reliability patterns, with most generations achieving at least 200,000 miles when properly maintained. The key to maximizing Civic longevity lies in following Honda's maintenance schedule and addressing generation-specific issues proactively.

## Honda Civic Reliability by Generation

### Sixth Generation (1996-2000): 200,000-280,000 Miles

The sixth-generation Civic established Honda's reputation for exceptional reliability. The 1.6L SOHC and VTEC engines are virtually indestructible when maintained, while the simple manual and automatic transmissions rarely require major repairs.

**Most Reliable Years:** 1999-2000 (post-refinement)

**Common Issues:**
- Timing belt replacement every 105,000 miles
- CV joints (high-mileage examples)
- Power steering pump leaks (minor)

**Expected Lifespan:** 200,000-280,000 miles
**Annual Maintenance Cost (after 100k):** $350-500

### Seventh Generation (2001-2005): 220,000-300,000 Miles

This generation introduced the K-series engine in later years while maintaining the reliable D-series in base models. Both engines prove exceptionally durable with proper maintenance.

**Most Reliable Years:** 2003-2005 (mature platform)

**Common Issues:**
- Timing belt service (D-series engines)
- Transmission mount wear (automatic models)
- Door lock actuator failures (common but inexpensive)

**Expected Lifespan:** 220,000-300,000 miles
**Annual Maintenance Cost (after 100k):** $400-600

### Eighth Generation (2006-2011): 250,000-350,000 Miles

The eighth-generation Civic represents peak Honda reliability engineering. The 1.8L R18 engine and 2.0L K20 engines are exceptionally long-lived, while the 5-speed automatic transmission proves very durable.

**Most Reliable Years:** 2009-2011 (post-initial refinements)

**Common Issues:**
- Engine block cracking (2006-2008 1.8L, extended warranty)
- AC compressor failures (around 120,000 miles)
- Paint quality concerns (some colors)

**Expected Lifespan:** 250,000-350,000 miles
**Annual Maintenance Cost (after 100k):** $375-550

### Ninth Generation (2012-2015): 200,000-280,000 Miles

The ninth generation shows good reliability but slightly more complexity than previous generations. The 1.8L R18 and 2.4L K24 engines remain durable, though the CVT transmission introduces new variables.

**Most Reliable Years:** 2014-2015 (CVT refinements)

**Common Issues:**
- CVT transmission whining (mostly cosmetic)
- Excessive A/C clutch cycling
- Paint and interior quality concerns

**Expected Lifespan:** 200,000-280,000 miles
**Annual Maintenance Cost (after 100k):** $450-650

### Tenth Generation (2016-2021): 180,000-250,000 Miles (Early Data)

The current generation introduces turbocharged engines and more complex systems. Early reliability data shows promise, but long-term durability data remains limited.

**Most Reliable Years:** 2019-2021 (post-initial issues)

**Common Issues:**
- 1.5L turbo engine oil dilution (2016-2018, TSB issued)
- CVT transmission juddering (early models)
- Infotainment system glitches

**Expected Lifespan:** 180,000-250,000 miles (preliminary data)
**Annual Maintenance Cost (projected):** $500-750

### Eleventh Generation (2022-Present): Too New to Rate

The latest Civic returns to naturally aspirated engines for base models while refining the turbocharged option. Initial quality appears strong, but longevity data won't be available for several years.
