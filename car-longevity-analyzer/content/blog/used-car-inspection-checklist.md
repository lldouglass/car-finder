## Why a Thorough Inspection Matters

A used car might look perfect in photos and drive fine for 10 minutes, but hidden problems can cost thousands. This comprehensive checklist covers everything you should examine before handing over your money. Print it out or save it on your phone — it could save you from buying a lemon.

Before you even visit the car, run the year, make, and model through [Car Lifespan Check](https://carlifespancheck.com) to understand known issues, recall history, and reliability scores for that specific vehicle.

## Before You Visit: Remote Checks

- [ ] Research the vehicle's reliability rating and known issues
- [ ] Check [Car Lifespan Check](https://carlifespancheck.com) for NHTSA data and reliability scores
- [ ] Look up the VIN for recalls at nhtsa.gov/recalls
- [ ] Compare the asking price with KBB, Edmunds, and NADA values
- [ ] Search for the VIN online — it may reveal hidden listings or issues
- [ ] Ask the seller for the VIN and photos before visiting

## Exterior Inspection

### Body and Paint
- [ ] Walk around the entire car in daylight
- [ ] Check for paint color mismatches between panels (indicates body work)
- [ ] Look for overspray on rubber seals, trim, and glass edges
- [ ] Examine body panel gaps — they should be even on both sides
- [ ] Check for dents, scratches, and signs of filler (use a magnet on steel-body cars)
- [ ] Look for rust on wheel wells, rocker panels, door edges, and trunk lid

### Glass and Lights
- [ ] Inspect windshield for chips and cracks
- [ ] Check all windows for proper operation
- [ ] Test all exterior lights: headlights (low and high beam), taillights, brake lights, turn signals, reverse lights, fog lights
- [ ] Look for moisture inside headlight or taillight housings

### Wheels and Tires
- [ ] Check tire tread depth (use the penny test: insert penny head-down; if you see all of Lincoln's head, tires need replacement)
- [ ] Look for uneven tire wear (indicates alignment or suspension issues)
- [ ] Inspect sidewalls for bulges, cracks, or damage
- [ ] Check that all four tires are the same brand and size
- [ ] Examine wheels for curb damage or cracks

### Undercarriage
- [ ] Look under the car for fluid leaks (oil, coolant, transmission fluid)
- [ ] Check for rust on frame rails and subframe
- [ ] Inspect exhaust system for holes, rust, or loose hangers
- [ ] Look for fresh undercoating that might be hiding rust

## Engine Bay Inspection

- [ ] Check oil level and condition (should be amber/brown, not black or milky)
- [ ] Inspect coolant (should be green/orange, not rusty or milky — milky coolant indicates head gasket failure)
- [ ] Check transmission fluid if accessible (should be red/pink, not brown or burnt-smelling)
- [ ] Look for brake fluid level and color
- [ ] Inspect belts for cracks, fraying, or glazing
- [ ] Check hoses for bulges, cracks, or soft spots
- [ ] Look for corrosion on battery terminals
- [ ] Check for oil leaks around valve covers, oil pan, and rear main seal
- [ ] Look for evidence of rodent damage to wiring
- [ ] Verify the VIN on the engine matches the title

## Interior Inspection

### Controls and Electronics
- [ ] Test air conditioning (should blow cold within 30 seconds)
- [ ] Test heater (should blow hot)
- [ ] Operate all power windows
- [ ] Test all door locks (key fob and manual)
- [ ] Check power mirrors
- [ ] Test windshield wipers and washer fluid
- [ ] Verify all dashboard warning lights illuminate during startup, then turn off
- [ ] Test the infotainment system, Bluetooth, and navigation
- [ ] Check USB ports and aux input

### Seats and Interior
- [ ] Check seat adjustments (power and manual)
- [ ] Test heated/cooled seats if equipped
- [ ] Examine upholstery for tears, stains, or excessive wear
- [ ] Check wear patterns — do they match the stated mileage?
- [ ] Look for water stains on carpet, headliner, and trunk (flood damage indicator)
- [ ] Smell for mold, mildew, or heavy air freshener (may be masking odors)
- [ ] Test all seatbelts for proper retraction and latching

### Safety Equipment
- [ ] Verify airbag warning light behavior (on during startup, then off)
- [ ] Check that the horn works
- [ ] Test parking brake
- [ ] Inspect spare tire and jack

## Test Drive Checklist

### Cold Start
- [ ] Start the engine cold (ask seller not to warm it up before you arrive)
- [ ] Listen for unusual sounds: knocking, ticking, grinding
- [ ] Watch exhaust: blue smoke = oil burning, white smoke = coolant leak, black smoke = rich fuel mixture
- [ ] Verify all warning lights turn off after starting

### Driving
- [ ] Test acceleration from stop — should be smooth without hesitation
- [ ] Listen for transmission shifts — should be smooth without jerks or delays
- [ ] Drive on a highway — check for vibrations at speed
- [ ] Test brakes at various speeds — pedal should be firm, car should stop straight
- [ ] Turn the steering wheel fully in both directions — listen for clicking (CV joints)
- [ ] Drive over bumps — listen for clunks or rattles (suspension)
- [ ] Test on a straight, flat road — car should track straight without pulling
- [ ] Accelerate hard once — check for slipping or unusual noises
- [ ] Drive at least 20–30 minutes to let the engine fully warm up

### After the Drive
- [ ] Park and look under the car for new fluid leaks
- [ ] Check that the engine temperature gauge is in normal range
- [ ] Verify the engine idles smoothly when warm

## Documentation Checklist

- [ ] Title is in the seller's name (not someone else's)
- [ ] Title is clean (no salvage, rebuilt, or flood designation)
- [ ] VIN on title matches VIN on dashboard, door jamb, and engine
- [ ] Odometer reading matches title and vehicle history report
- [ ] Service records are available and consistent
- [ ] Number of owners matches the seller's claims
- [ ] No outstanding liens on the vehicle

## When to Walk Away

Some issues are deal-breakers regardless of price:

- **Milky oil or coolant** — head gasket failure is expensive to repair
- **Frame damage or severe rust** — structural integrity is compromised
- **Transmission slipping or jerking** — rebuilds cost $2,000–$5,000+
- **Seller won't allow inspection** — they're hiding something
- **VIN discrepancies** — possible stolen vehicle or title fraud
- **Flood damage signs** — water damage causes endless electrical problems

## Get Professional Backup

Even with this checklist, a professional pre-purchase inspection ($100–$300) catches things you'll miss. An independent mechanic can put the car on a lift, run diagnostic scans, and assess components you can't see from the outside.

And before you visit any car, use [Car Lifespan Check](https://carlifespancheck.com) to research the vehicle's reliability history. It takes two minutes and could save you from a car with known widespread issues.

Happy hunting — and don't buy a lemon.
