# How Long Does a Subaru Outback Last? Complete Reliability and Longevity Analysis

The Subaru Outback occupies a unique niche: all-wheel-drive wagon/crossover with a loyal fanbase that insists it's the most reliable car on the road. The reality is more nuanced. The Outback can absolutely last 200,000-300,000 miles, but Subaru's history with head gasket failures and oil consumption means you need to know exactly which years and engines to target. Buying the wrong Outback can cost you $3,000+ in engine repairs before you hit 150,000 miles.

## Expected Lifespan: 200,000 to 250,000 Miles (With Caveats)

A properly maintained Outback will deliver 200,000-250,000 miles. Some owners report 300,000+, but that's less common than with Toyota or Honda equivalents. The Outback's boxer engine design, while great for handling and a low center of gravity, introduces maintenance complexity and specific failure modes that inline-four competitors don't have.

## The Head Gasket Problem: Subaru's Achilles Heel

Before diving into generations, this needs to be addressed upfront because it affects nearly every Outback built between 1996 and 2010.

Subaru's EJ-series boxer engines (2.5L naturally aspirated) had a chronic head gasket failure problem. The gaskets would develop external leaks, allowing coolant and oil to seep from the head-to-block mating surface. This wasn't a catastrophic failure (the engine would usually keep running), but left unaddressed, it would eventually overheat the engine and cause real damage.

**Affected engines:** EJ25 (2.5L) in naturally aspirated form, 1996-2010.

**Repair cost:** $1,500-$2,500 at an independent Subaru shop. Dealer pricing can hit $3,000-$3,500.

**When it happens:** Typically between 80,000-150,000 miles.

The turbocharged EJ25 (in the Outback XT) had a different head gasket design and did not suffer from this issue. The naturally aspirated FB25 engine (2012+) also uses a redesigned multi-layer steel gasket that has essentially eliminated this problem.

## Generation-by-Generation Breakdown

### 3rd Generation (2005-2009): Proceed with Caution

The EJ253 2.5L boxer four in these Outbacks is the peak of Subaru's head gasket troubles. Nearly every naturally aspirated 2005-2009 Outback will need head gaskets at some point if they haven't been done already.

**Known issues:**
- **Head gaskets** (see above). On a 2005-2009 Outback with 100,000+ miles, the first question is: "Have the head gaskets been replaced?" If yes, with what gaskets? (Multi-layer steel replacements from Six Star or OEM updated gaskets are good; cheap aftermarket gaskets will fail again.)
- **Catalytic converter failure** at 100,000-150,000 miles, causing a P0420 code. Replacement runs $800-$1,500.
- **Wheel bearing failures** at 80,000-120,000 miles ($300-$500 per corner).

**The XT turbo:** The 2005-2009 Outback 2.5XT with the EJ255 turbo engine is actually more robust in terms of head gaskets, but it has its own issues: turbo failure at high mileage ($1,200-$2,000), and these engines are sensitive to oil change intervals. Miss one oil change and the turbo bearings can be damaged.

### 4th Generation (2010-2014): The Transition Era

The 2010-2011 models still used the EJ253 with its head gasket susceptibility. The 2012-2014 models switched to the all-new FB25 engine with a timing chain (instead of a timing belt) and redesigned head gaskets.

**2010-2011:** Same head gasket risk as the 3rd generation. These are the last of the EJ25 Outbacks.

**2012-2014 (FB25):**
- **Oil consumption.** Subaru settled a class-action lawsuit over excessive oil consumption in 2012-2017 FB25 engines. Some engines consumed 1 quart every 1,000-1,500 miles. Subaru offered an "oil consumption test" and would replace short blocks on the worst offenders under an extended warranty (up to 100,000 miles). If you're buying one, perform an oil consumption test: fill to the full mark, drive 1,200 miles, and check the level.
- **CVT transmission.** Subaru introduced the Lineartronic CVT in 2010. Early units (2010-2013) had some reported failures at 100,000-150,000 miles. Replacement cost: $4,000-$6,500. Subaru extended the CVT warranty to 100,000 miles on certain models.
- **No more timing belt.** The FB25 uses a timing chain, saving the $800-$1,200 timing belt service required every 105,000 miles on the EJ25.

### 5th Generation (2015-2019): Improving but Not Perfect

The FB25 continued with incremental improvements. Oil consumption decreased in later production years, and the CVT received improved programming and hardware.

**Known issues:**
- **2015-2016:** Still some oil consumption complaints, though fewer than 2012-2014.
- **2017-2019:** Oil consumption largely resolved. The CVT is more refined with fewer reported failures.
- **Battery drain:** Some 2015-2019 owners reported parasitic battery drain caused by the Starlink infotainment system. A software update typically resolves this.
- **Windshield cracking:** An oddly common complaint across 2015-2019 Outbacks. The windshield seems unusually susceptible to cracks from small rocks. Not a reliability issue per se, but an annoying $300-$600 replacement.

**2018-2019 are the sweet spot** in this generation. The FB25 is refined, the CVT is proven, and prices have dropped to $16,000-$22,000 for well-equipped models.

### 6th Generation (2020-Present): The Best Outback Yet

Built on Subaru's new Global Platform, the 6th-gen Outback is a significant improvement in rigidity, ride quality, and safety. The FA24 2.4L turbo boxer four (in the Onyx XT and above) replaces the old EJ turbo with a modern direct-injected engine.

**Known issues:**
- **2020:** First-year infotainment bugs with the massive 11.6-inch touchscreen. Software updates have addressed most complaints.
- **FA24 turbo:** Very early data, but no major mechanical issues reported. This is the same engine family used in the Toyota GR86 and Subaru WRX (in different tunes), so there's a broader reliability dataset forming.
- **FB25 (base engine):** Continues in the base, Premium, and Limited trims. Oil consumption appears to be a non-issue in these later versions.

## The CVT Question

Subaru's CVT is the number one concern for long-term Outback ownership. Here's the honest assessment:

**2010-2013 CVTs:** Higher failure risk. Budget for potential replacement or buy with low enough mileage that you'll be within the extended warranty.

**2014-2019 CVTs:** Significantly improved. With proper fluid changes (every 30,000-40,000 miles, not the 60,000+ Subaru recommends), these are lasting well past 150,000 miles.

**2020+ CVTs:** Too early for definitive data, but the new Global Platform CVT has a different torque converter and improved chain design.

**Critical maintenance:** Change CVT fluid every 30,000-40,000 miles. Subaru's "60,000 mile severe service" interval is too long for a transmission you want to last 200,000 miles. CVT fluid change cost: $200-$350 at a dealer.

## Maintenance Costs

The Outback is more expensive to maintain than a comparable front-wheel-drive car due to AWD complexity:

- **Annual average maintenance:** $596 (higher than Camry/Accord class, lower than German competitors)
- **Head gasket replacement (EJ25):** $1,500-$2,500
- **Timing belt service (EJ25 only, every 105,000 miles):** $800-$1,200
- **CVT fluid change:** $200-$350
- **Wheel bearing replacement:** $300-$500 per corner
- **Brake pads and rotors (all four):** $400-$600
- **Catalytic converter:** $800-$1,500

## Best Years to Buy

**Best budget pick (under $12,000):** 2013-2014 with the FB25 engine. No head gasket issues, has the timing chain, and old enough to be affordable. Verify oil consumption and CVT health before buying.

**Best overall value:** 2018-2019 Outback Premium or Limited. Refined FB25, proven CVT, excellent safety ratings, prices around $16,000-$22,000.

**Best for towing/power:** 2020+ Outback Onyx XT with the FA24 turbo. 260 hp, 277 lb-ft of torque, and a 3,500-lb tow rating.

## Years to Avoid

- **2005-2011 (any with the EJ25 NA engine):** Head gasket failures are nearly guaranteed if not already addressed. Only buy if head gaskets have been replaced with multi-layer steel units AND the price reflects the age.
- **2010-2012 (CVT concerns):** First-generation CVT with higher failure rates.
- **2013 (oil consumption):** The worst year for FB25 oil consumption issues.

## Making an Outback Last 250,000+ Miles

1. **Oil changes every 5,000 miles** with 0W-20 full synthetic. Do not stretch to 6,000+.
2. **CVT fluid every 30,000-40,000 miles.** This is non-negotiable.
3. **Monitor oil consumption** on 2012-2016 models. If it's consuming more than 1 quart per 3,000 miles, address it before it causes catalytic converter damage.
4. **Timing belt every 105,000 miles** (EJ25 only). Do the water pump at the same time ($200 extra in parts).
5. **Inspect wheel bearings** at every oil change. Listen for humming that changes with speed.
6. **Rust prevention** on the undercarriage if you're in a salt-belt state. Subaru frames are not known for exceptional corrosion resistance.

## The Contrarian Take

Subaru owners are among the most loyal in the industry, and online forums can create an echo chamber where the Outback is presented as just as reliable as a Corolla or CR-V. The data doesn't support that. The Outback has more model-year-specific issues, higher average repair costs, and a CVT that requires more attention than Toyota or Honda's offerings.

That said, the Outback offers something no competitor in its price range matches: standard AWD, wagon practicality, and genuine off-road capability. If you need those things (and in Colorado, the Pacific Northwest, or New England, you genuinely might), the Outback is worth the slightly higher maintenance burden. Just buy the right year.
