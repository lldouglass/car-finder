## Ford vs Chevy Maintenance Costs Over 10 Years (2026)

If you are comparing Ford and Chevrolet for long-term ownership, maintenance cost is where the decision gets real. The badge on the grille matters less than the exact model, engine, and transmission you buy.

Across mainstream models, Ford and Chevy can both be reasonable to own. But over a 10-year period, specific powertrains can create a $2,000 to $6,000 gap in total maintenance and repair spending. This guide breaks down what that looks like in plain numbers.

For a broader reliability breakdown, read our [Ford vs Chevy reliability comparison](/blog/ford-vs-chevy-reliability-comparison) and [GM vs Ford reliability guide](/blog/gm-vs-ford-reliability-compared).

## Quick Answer: Which Brand Is Cheaper to Maintain?

For most 10-year ownership scenarios:

- **Chevy is often slightly cheaper** on routine maintenance and common repairs.
- **Ford can be cheaper or more expensive** depending on whether you choose naturally aspirated engines or EcoBoost turbo setups.
- **The biggest cost swing** usually comes from known failure points (AFM lifters on some GM V8s, turbo-related repairs on some Ford engines).

So the winner is not just "Ford" or "Chevy." The winner is the right model and engine.

## 10-Year Maintenance Cost Ranges (Typical Ownership)

Below are realistic ranges for owners who drive about 12,000 miles per year and keep up with routine service.

| Vehicle Type | Ford 10-Year Cost | Chevy 10-Year Cost | Typical Winner |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Full-size truck | $9,800 - $15,500 | $9,200 - $16,200 | Tie (engine-dependent) |
| Mid-size SUV | $8,200 - $13,200 | $7,900 - $12,900 | Slight Chevy edge |
| Compact crossover | $7,400 - $11,800 | $7,100 - $11,200 | Slight Chevy edge |
| Older sedan ownership | $6,800 - $10,500 | $6,600 - $10,200 | Near tie |

These ranges include routine service plus expected wear-item repairs. They do not include accidents, insurance, or fuel.

## Where the Money Actually Goes

Most owners underestimate two things: transmission service intervals and high-mileage component failures.

### Routine Maintenance (10 Years)

Routine maintenance includes oil changes, brakes, fluid changes, tires, plugs, filters, and scheduled inspections.

- Ford typical routine total: **$5,000 - $7,000**
- Chevy typical routine total: **$4,800 - $6,800**

Not a huge difference by itself.

### Repair Risk Costs (10 Years)

Repair-risk cost is where real separation happens.

- Ford additional repair risk: **$2,000 - $8,000** depending on engine and transmission
- Chevy additional repair risk: **$1,800 - $8,500** depending on AFM/DFM V8 and transmission generation

One major failure can erase years of small maintenance savings.

## Truck Ownership: F-150 vs Silverado Cost Reality

Truck buyers often ask this exact question because both platforms are everywhere.

### Ford F-150 (10-Year Pattern)

- 5.0L V8 setups tend to be more predictable long-term
- EcoBoost trims can cost more if turbo, intercooler, or timing-related issues show up
- Transmission service consistency matters a lot

### Chevy Silverado 1500 (10-Year Pattern)

- Routine costs are generally competitive
- AFM-era lifter failures can create big one-time repair bills
- Later DFM generations look better so far, but long-range data is still building

**Bottom line for trucks:** both can be solid. Choose based on proven engine-year combinations, not brand loyalty.

If you are cross-shopping full-size pickups and used reliability matters most, pair this with our [most reliable cars under $15K guide](/blog/most-reliable-cars-under-15k) to calibrate long-term ownership expectations versus newer truck costs.

## SUV Ownership: Where Buyers Get Surprised

SUVs are often used as family daily drivers, which means mileage piles up fast.

- Ford Explorer and some complex three-row configurations can become expensive after warranty.
- Chevy's core SUV lineup is mixed, with some models showing better durability than others.

The main rule: avoid known trouble-year combinations and budget for transmission and suspension work after 100k miles.

## Most Common Expensive Repairs (Ford vs Chevy)

These are the repairs that can swing your 10-year ownership total.

| Repair Type | Typical Cost Range | More Common In |
|---|---:|---|
| Turbocharger-related repair | $1,200 - $3,500 | Ford turbo setups |
| AFM/DFM lifter and cam repair | $3,000 - $5,500 | Some Chevy V8 years |
| Transmission rebuild/replacement | $3,500 - $7,000 | Both (year-specific) |
| Timing component repair | $1,500 - $3,500 | Both (engine-specific) |
| Suspension refresh (high-mileage SUV) | $1,000 - $2,800 | Both |

The takeaway is simple: any single major failure dominates your cost curve.

## How to Save $3,000+ Over 10 Years (Regardless of Brand)

### 1) Buy the right engine first
A good engine-year combo beats a cheap purchase price every time.

### 2) Change fluids earlier than the max interval
Transmission and coolant neglect is one of the biggest long-term cost multipliers.

### 3) Do pre-purchase inspections on used vehicles
A $150 inspection can prevent a $4,000 mistake.

### 4) Track maintenance history from day one
Good records improve resale value and help catch patterns before failures escalate.

### 5) Avoid first model-year redesigns when possible
Later model years in a generation usually have fewer expensive surprises.

## Who Should Pick Ford vs Chevy in 2026?

Choose **Ford** if:
- You are targeting proven truck trims and specific low-risk engine years
- You prioritize F-series resale strength

Choose **Chevy** if:
- You want slightly lower average routine maintenance costs
- You are avoiding known AFM-era high-risk V8 years

Either brand can be a good long-term buy if you choose model-year-powertrain carefully.

## Final Verdict

Over 10 years, Ford vs Chevy maintenance cost is too close to call at the brand level. Most buyers will see a small Chevy edge on routine ownership cost, but the real outcome depends on avoiding known failure-prone configurations.

Use this framework with our [Ford reliability guide for long-term ownership](/blog/is-ford-reliable-long-term) before you buy. If you pick the right model and keep maintenance disciplined, both brands can deliver strong long-term value.
