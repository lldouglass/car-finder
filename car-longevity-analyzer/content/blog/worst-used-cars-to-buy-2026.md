## Used Cars to Avoid in 2026: The High-Risk List

Certain used cars present significant financial risks due to well-documented reliability problems, expensive repair costs, and poor long-term value retention. The worst used cars to buy in 2026 include models with known transmission failures, engine problems, and discontinued support. Nissan CVT transmission failures alone affect over 3 million vehicles, while models like the Chrysler 200 and Dodge Journey combine poor reliability with rapidly depreciating values.

Smart used car buyers avoid these problematic models in favor of more reliable alternatives. The money saved on purchase price rarely compensates for the higher repair costs, safety concerns, and poor resale value these vehicles present.

## Nissan Models with CVT Transmission Failures

### Nissan Altima (2013-2018): Avoid Completely

The Nissan Altima's CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission) shows catastrophic failure rates that make it one of the worst used car purchases available.

## The Bottom Line

Avoiding problematic used cars saves thousands in repair costs and prevents safety concerns. The models listed here show consistent patterns of expensive failures that far exceed normal vehicle maintenance costs.

Smart buyers research reliability data, understand common problems, and choose proven alternatives over risky bargains. The money saved on purchase price rarely compensates for the stress and expense of owning an unreliable vehicle.

Focus on models with proven track records, even if they cost slightly more upfront. The peace of mind and lower total ownership costs justify the premium for reliable transportation.
