Ford's reliability reputation has been a rollercoaster. In 2020, Ford ranked near the bottom of J.D. Power's Vehicle Dependability Study. By 2025, they climbed to the middle of the pack. The question Ford buyers keep asking in 2026: has Ford reliability genuinely improved, or is this a temporary blip?

The short answer: it depends entirely on which Ford you buy. Some 2026 models are legitimately excellent. Others carry over problems that Ford has been unable to fix for years. Here is the model-by-model breakdown.

## Ford's Overall Reliability Trajectory

| Year | J.D. Power VDS Rank | Consumer Reports Reliability | Notable Issues |
|------|---------------------|------|------|
| 2020 | 28 of 32 | Below Average | Explorer launch disasters, 10-speed transmission |
| 2021 | 23 of 33 | Below Average | Bronco launch issues, chip shortage quality |
| 2022 | 18 of 36 | Average | Improvement begins, fewer recalls |
| 2023 | 15 of 36 | Average | F-150 and Maverick strong performers |
| 2024 | 14 of 37 | Average | Electric model teething continues |
| 2025 | 12 of 37 | Above Average | Best ranking in a decade |

The trend is real. Ford improved from bottom-five to above-average in five years. But the averages mask huge variance between models.

## Most Reliable Ford Models in 2026

### Ford Maverick: Ford's Best Reliability Story
**Reliability Rating: Above Average**

The Maverick is the most reliable vehicle in Ford's entire lineup. The 2.5L hybrid powertrain uses proven Toyota-derived hybrid technology (Ford and Toyota co-developed hybrid patents). Owners report minimal issues, low maintenance costs, and exceptional fuel economy (42 mpg city).

**5-Year Cost of Ownership:** $3,200-$4,800 in maintenance and repairs
**Expected Lifespan:** 200,000-250,000 miles

### Ford F-150 (Non-PowerBoost): Strong and Improving
**Reliability Rating: Average to Above Average**

The 3.5L EcoBoost and 5.0L V8 in the F-150 have both matured significantly. The 10-speed automatic transmission, which caused widespread problems in 2017-2019, has been recalibrated and reinforced. The 2023+ F-150 models show dramatically fewer transmission complaints in NHTSA data.

**5-Year Cost of Ownership:** $4,500-$6,500 in maintenance and repairs
**Expected Lifespan:** 200,000-300,000 miles (V8), 180,000-250,000 miles (EcoBoost)

### Ford Bronco Sport: Surprisingly Solid
**Reliability Rating: Average**

Not to be confused with the full-size Bronco, the Bronco Sport shares its platform with the Escape and benefits from that model's years of refinement. The 1.5L and 2.0L EcoBoost engines are well-proven.

**Expected Lifespan:** 180,000-220,000 miles

## Ford Models With Ongoing Reliability Concerns

### Ford Explorer (2020+): Still Problematic
**Reliability Rating: Below Average**

The 2020 Explorer was one of Ford's worst launches in recent memory. Rear-wheel-drive platform, new 10-speed transmission, and rushed production quality created a storm of recalls and complaints. While 2024-2026 models are improved, the Explorer still ranks below average in reliability surveys.

**Common Issues:** Transmission hesitation, infotainment freezes, rear axle noise
**Expected Lifespan:** 150,000-200,000 miles

### Ford Mustang Mach-E: Electric Growing Pains
**Reliability Rating: Below Average**

Ford's electric vehicles are improving but still lag behind Tesla and Hyundai/Kia EVs in reliability surveys. The Mach-E has reported issues with 12V battery drain, software glitches, and charging system inconsistencies.

### Ford Escape (2020+): Mediocre
**Reliability Rating: Average**

The current Escape is not bad, but it is not good either. Oil dilution concerns on the 1.5L EcoBoost (fuel mixing with oil in cold weather) and some transmission shift quality complaints keep it from standing out.

## How Ford's 2026 Models Compare to 2021

The improvement is measurable:

| Model | 2021 Reliability | 2026 Reliability | Change |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|--------|
| F-150 | Below Average | Above Average | Significant improvement |
| Maverick | N/A (launched 2022) | Above Average | New entry, strong |
| Explorer | Well Below Average | Below Average | Some improvement |
| Escape | Below Average | Average | Moderate improvement |
| Bronco | Well Below Average | Average | Improved from rough launch |
| Edge | Average | Discontinued | N/A |

The biggest single improvement is the F-150. Ford's most important vehicle went from a reliability liability to one of the more dependable trucks in its class. The 10-speed transmission fix and better quality control at the Dearborn and Kansas City plants made a real difference.

## Ford vs Competitors in 2026

How does Ford's improved reliability compare to other brands?

**Ford vs Toyota:** Toyota still wins overall. The [Tundra](/blog/toyota-tundra-lifespan-how-long-does-it-last) and Tacoma outlast the F-150 and Ranger by 50,000-100,000 miles on average. But the gap has narrowed. A well-maintained F-150 is now competitive with mid-tier Japanese trucks.

**Ford vs Chevy:** A genuine toss-up. Our detailed [Ford vs Chevy comparison](/blog/ford-vs-chevy-reliability-comparison) shows Ford winning on some models (F-150 vs Silverado) and Chevy winning on others (Equinox vs Escape). The [10-year maintenance cost comparison](/blog/ford-vs-chevy-maintenance-costs-10-year-2026) gives a slight edge to Ford overall, driven by lower F-150 repair costs.

**Ford vs Honda/Hyundai:** Honda still leads on car reliability, but Ford's truck reliability now exceeds Honda's Ridgeline. Hyundai/Kia have surged in recent years with excellent warranty coverage, making them strong competitors in the crossover/SUV segment.

## Should You Buy a Ford in 2026?

**Buy with confidence:**
- Ford Maverick (hybrid or EcoBoost): best value in Ford's lineup
- Ford F-150 (2023+, V8 or EcoBoost): the reliability issue is largely resolved
- Ford Bronco Sport: solid small SUV

**Buy with caution:**
- Ford Explorer: improved but still below average
- Ford Bronco (full-size): better than launch but not yet proven long-term
- Any Ford EV: improving but not yet matching competitor reliability

**Avoid:**
- Any 2020-2021 Ford Explorer (the worst of the reliability valley)
- 2017-2019 F-150 with 10-speed transmission (the pre-fix models)

## Bottom Line

Ford's reliability has genuinely improved from 2021 to 2026. This is not marketing spin. The J.D. Power and Consumer Reports data confirms a real upward trend. But Ford is still not Toyota or Honda tier for overall reliability. The smart play is buying the specific Ford models that have proven themselves (Maverick, F-150) and avoiding the ones that have not.
