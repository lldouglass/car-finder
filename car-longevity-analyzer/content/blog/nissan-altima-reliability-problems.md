## Conclusion: The Altima Reliability Reality

The Nissan Altima presents a complex reliability picture. While offering competitive features and pricing, significant issues with CVT transmissions and some engine problems make it a risky choice compared to more reliable alternatives.

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **CVT transmission issues** are the primary concern across multiple generations
2. **2013-2016 models** should be avoided entirely
3. **Pre-CVT models (2002-2006)** offer much better reliability
4. **Manual transmission models** eliminate the CVT concern
5. **Maintenance is critical** for extending CVT life

**Buying Recommendations:**

**Safe Choices:**
- Pre-2007 models with traditional automatics
- Any year with manual transmission
- Low-mileage models with complete service records

**Avoid:**
- 2013-2016 model years entirely
- High-mileage CVT models
- Vehicles with unknown maintenance history

**Risk Assessment:**
For buyers prioritizing reliability and low long-term costs, the Honda Accord or Toyota Camry represent much safer choices. The Altima may appeal to budget-conscious buyers willing to accept higher risk in exchange for lower purchase prices, but the potential for expensive CVT failures makes it a questionable value proposition.

**Bottom Line:**
While Nissan continues to improve the Altima, its reliability reputation remains problematic. Unless you find an exceptional deal on a well-maintained example or choose a pre-CVT model, there are better alternatives available in the competitive midsize sedan market. If you do choose an Altima, budget for potential transmission replacement and maintain it religiously to maximize your chances of trouble-free ownership.
