## How Long Does a Subaru Outback Last?

A well-maintained Subaru Outback typically lasts 200,000 to 300,000 miles, with many examples exceeding 250,000 miles when properly maintained. The average life of a Subaru Outback is approximately 13-17 years, making it one of the longer-lasting midsize SUVs on the market. According to iSeeCars data, 9.2% of Outback vehicles reach 200,000+ miles, ranking it among the top 20 longest-lasting vehicles.

The key to maximizing Outback longevity lies in understanding generation-specific strengths and maintenance requirements. Different generations face unique challenges, from head gasket issues in older models to CVT transmission concerns in newer ones.

## Subaru Outback Lifespan by Generation

### First Generation (1995-1999): 200,000+ Miles

The original Outback was essentially a lifted Legacy wagon, and these models are surprisingly durable when maintained. The 2.5L SOHC engine is robust, though head gasket failures around 100,000-150,000 miles are common.

**Common Issues:**
- Head gasket failure (90,000-150,000 miles)
- Timing belt replacement every 105,000 miles
- CV joint wear (high-mileage examples)

**Expected Lifespan:** 200,000-250,000 miles
**Maintenance Cost:** $400-600 annually after 100k miles

### Second Generation (2000-2004): 180,000-220,000 Miles

This generation introduced the infamous 2.5L SOHC head gasket problems. While these engines can be very long-lived after head gasket repair, the repair costs often exceed the vehicle's value.

**Common Issues:**
- Head gasket failure (100,000-130,000 miles) - $2,000-3,000 repair
- Timing belt service every 105,000 miles
- Ball joint and strut wear

**Expected Lifespan:** 180,000-220,000 miles (with head gasket repair)
**Maintenance Cost:** $500-800 annually after 100k miles

### Third Generation (2005-2009): 220,000-280,000 Miles

The introduction of the 2.5L DOHC engine improved reliability significantly. These models still face head gasket issues but less frequently than the SOHC engines. The 3.0L H6 engine is exceptionally reliable but more expensive to maintain.

**Most Reliable Years:** 2008-2009 (after initial generation refinements)

**Common Issues:**
- Head gasket failure (less common than previous generation)
- Timing belt service (3.0L H6 only)
- CVT transmission issues (late models)

**Expected Lifespan:** 220,000-280,000 miles
**Maintenance Cost:** $450-650 annually after 100k miles

### Fourth Generation (2010-2014): 250,000-300,000 Miles

This generation represents peak Outback reliability. The 2.5L FB25 engine introduced in 2013 eliminated most head gasket concerns. CVT transmissions became standard, bringing new reliability questions but generally proving durable.

**Most Reliable Years:** 2013-2014 (FB25 engine introduction)

**Common Issues:**
- Oil consumption (some 2013-2014 models)
- CVT transmission whining (mostly cosmetic)
- Suspension wear at higher mileage

**Expected Lifespan:** 250,000-300,000 miles
**Maintenance Cost:** $400-550 annually after 100k miles

### Fifth Generation (2015-2019): 200,000-280,000 Miles

The current-generation Outback continues using the reliable FB25 engine with continuous improvements. CVT transmissions have proven generally reliable, though some early examples experienced issues.

**Most Reliable Years:** 2017-2019 (post-initial refinements)

**Common Issues:**
- CVT transmission shuddering (2015-2016 models)
- Infotainment system glitches
- Minor electrical issues

**Expected Lifespan:** 200,000-280,000 miles (still accumulating data)
**Maintenance Cost:** $350-500 annually after 100k miles

### Sixth Generation (2020-Present): TBD

Too early to determine long-term reliability, but early indicators suggest continued improvement. The 2.5L FB25 engine remains largely unchanged, and CVT reliability continues improving.

## Factors That Affect Outback Lifespan

### 1. Maintenance Schedule Adherence

Subarus require specific maintenance timing, particularly for timing belts and head gasket monitoring. Following Subaru's severe duty schedule (every 6,000 miles for oil changes) significantly extends engine life.

### 2. Climate and Driving Conditions

Outbacks excel in harsh weather conditions, but salt exposure accelerates undercarriage corrosion. Regular undercarriage washing in winter climates extends structural longevity.

### 3. Engine Type

- **2.5L SOHC (1995-2004):** Reliable after head gasket repair
- **2.5L DOHC (2005-2012):** Good balance of power and reliability  
- **2.5L FB25 (2013+):** Most reliable Outback engine to date
- **3.0L H6 (2005-2009):** Extremely reliable but expensive to maintain

## Real-World High-Mileage Examples

RepairPal data shows numerous Outbacks exceeding 300,000 miles:

- **2005 Outback 2.5i:** 340,000 miles (original engine, head gaskets replaced at 125k)
- **2010 Outback 3.6R:** 290,000 miles (H6 engine, original transmission)
- **2013 Outback 2.5i:** 275,000 miles (FB25 engine, no major repairs)
- **2008 Outback XT:** 315,000 miles (turbocharged, extensive maintenance)

## Annual Maintenance Costs by Mileage

According to RepairPal data:

**60,000-100,000 Miles:**
- Average annual cost: $350-450
- Major services: 90k timing belt (if equipped)

**100,000-150,000 Miles:**
- Average annual cost: $500-700
- Major services: Head gasket monitoring, suspension components

**150,000-200,000 Miles:**
- Average annual cost: $600-800
- Major services: CVT service, major suspension overhaul

**200,000+ Miles:**
- Average annual cost: $700-1,000
- Major services: Engine rebuild consideration, transmission replacement

## Warning Signs Your Outback Needs Attention

### Immediate Concerns:
- External head gasket leaks (oil spots under car)
- CVT transmission shuddering or slipping
- Excessive oil consumption (more than 1 quart per 3,000 miles)

### Plan-Ahead Issues:
- Timing belt replacement schedule (non-FB25 engines)
- Suspension component wear (struts, ball joints)
- Brake system maintenance (mountain driving areas)

## Is a High-Mileage Outback Worth Buying?

Outbacks with 100,000-150,000 miles can be excellent purchases if:
- Head gasket service has been completed (pre-2013 models)
- Complete maintenance records are available
- Pre-purchase inspection shows good engine compression
- CVT transmission operates smoothly

Use a comprehensive analysis tool to evaluate any specific Outback's reliability potential based on its exact model year, mileage, and maintenance history.

## Maximizing Your Outback's Lifespan

### Essential Maintenance:
1. **Oil changes every 6,000 miles** (severe duty schedule)
2. **CVT transmission service every 60,000 miles**
3. **Coolant system monitoring** (head gasket prevention)
4. **Timing belt replacement** on schedule (pre-FB25 engines)
5. **Regular undercarriage washing** (corrosion prevention)

### Performance Modifications to Avoid:
- Aftermarket turbocharger installations
- Extreme lift kits that stress drivetrain
- Engine tuning that increases stress

## The Bottom Line

The Subaru Outback's longevity depends heavily on generation and maintenance. Third and fourth-generation models (2005-2014) offer the best combination of reliability and availability, while newer models show continued improvement. With proper maintenance, 250,000+ miles is achievable across most generations.

Before purchasing any used Outback, research the specific model year's common issues and verify maintenance history. A well-maintained Outback provides exceptional longevity for outdoor enthusiasts and practical families alike.
