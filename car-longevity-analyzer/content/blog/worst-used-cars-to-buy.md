## Some Used Cars Are Cheap for a Reason

A low price tag on a used car can be tempting, but there's often a reason certain models depreciate faster than others. High repair costs, chronic mechanical problems, and poor build quality make some vehicles money pits that cost more to own than cars that were twice the purchase price.

We've analyzed NHTSA complaint data, recall volumes, and average repair costs to identify the used cars you should avoid. Always verify a specific vehicle's history with [Car Lifespan Check](https://carlifespancheck.com) before making any purchase decision.

## Worst Used Sedans

### Nissan Altima (2013–2018)

The Altima's CVT transmission is its Achilles' heel. Nissan's Jatco CVT has one of the highest failure rates of any transmission in modern cars. Owners report shuddering, overheating, and complete failure — often before 100,000 miles. Replacement costs run $3,000–$5,000.

**Why it's bad:** CVT failures are widespread and expensive. Even cars that still work often feel "rubbery" and unresponsive.

### Chrysler 200 (2015–2017)

Chrysler discontinued the 200 for good reason. The nine-speed automatic transmission is notoriously unreliable, with owners reporting rough shifting, hesitation, and outright failure. Electrical issues and build quality problems compound the misery.

**Why it's bad:** Multiple system failures, poor resale value, and the brand no longer supports this model.

### Dodge Dart (2013–2016)

The Dart was Dodge's attempt at a compact sedan, and it was plagued with problems from day one. The dual-dry-clutch transmission in automatic models is a disaster, and the electrical system is riddled with gremlins. Parts availability is becoming an issue.

**Why it's bad:** Transmission problems, electrical failures, and dwindling parts support.

### Fiat 500 (2012–2019)

Charming to look at, miserable to own. The Fiat 500 suffers from chronic electrical issues, premature clutch wear, engine oil consumption, and overall poor build quality. Dealer support in the US has essentially evaporated.

**Why it's bad:** Everything except the styling. Repair frequency is among the highest of any car sold in America.

## Worst Used SUVs

### Jeep Cherokee (2014–2018)

The 2014 redesign introduced the ZF nine-speed automatic transmission, which is one of the worst transmissions in any modern vehicle. Harsh shifting, hesitation from a stop, and software glitches are common. The 2.4L engine also has excessive oil consumption issues.

**Why it's bad:** The transmission alone makes this a car to avoid. It may work fine for years or fail at 60,000 miles — it's a lottery.

### Nissan Pathfinder (2013–2017)

Same CVT problems as the Altima, but now in a heavier vehicle that puts even more stress on the transmission. The Pathfinder also suffers from coolant leaks and radiator issues that can contaminate the transmission fluid, causing catastrophic failure.

**Why it's bad:** CVT failures in a heavy SUV, plus the infamous "strawberry milkshake" transmission-coolant mixing issue.

### Ford Escape (2013–2016) — 1.6L EcoBoost

The 1.6L EcoBoost engine in these model years has serious coolant leak issues that can cause overheating and engine failure. Ford issued a safety recall for fire risk. The 2.0L and 2.5L engines are better, but the 1.6L is a genuine hazard.

**Why it's bad:** Engine coolant leaks leading to potential fires and engine failure. Check which engine the specific car has.

### Land Rover Discovery Sport (2015–2019)

Land Rover consistently ranks at the bottom of reliability surveys, and the Discovery Sport is a prime example. Electrical gremlins, transmission issues, air suspension failures, and infotainment problems make these SUVs incredibly expensive to maintain out of warranty.

**Why it's bad:** Beautiful inside and out, but reliability is abysmal and repair costs are astronomical.

## Worst Used Trucks

### Ram 1500 EcoDiesel (2014–2016)

The 3.0L EcoDiesel V6 sounded great on paper — a fuel-efficient diesel in a full-size truck. In reality, these engines suffer from emissions system failures, EGR problems, and expensive DEF system issues. Fiat Chrysler paid a massive settlement over emissions cheating with these engines.

**Why it's bad:** Diesel complexity combined with poor emissions system reliability. Repairs can run into the thousands.

---

## Worst Used Luxury Cars

### BMW X3 (2013–2017)

BMW's compact SUV looks great on the used market, but timing chain issues, oil leak problems, and expensive electronic failures make it a risky buy outside of warranty. Annual repair costs can easily exceed $2,000.

**Why it's bad:** Premium repair costs hit hard once the warranty expires. Timing chain and oil leak issues are widespread.

### Mercedes-Benz GLA (2015–2019)

The GLA suffers from a rough-shifting dual-clutch transmission, cramped interior, and Mercedes-level repair costs. It's the least satisfying Mercedes to own, combining the highest costs with the least luxury.

**Why it's bad:** All the expense of a Mercedes without the refinement, plus transmission issues.

## How to Avoid Buying a Problem Car

1. **Research before you shop** — use [Car Lifespan Check](https://carlifespancheck.com) to identify known issues for any year, make, and model
2. **Check NHTSA complaints** — high complaint volumes for specific model years are a red flag
3. **Get a pre-purchase inspection** — a mechanic can catch developing problems
4. **Read owner forums** — real owners share the unfiltered truth about their vehicles
5. **Avoid the first model year** of any redesign — let other buyers find the problems first

## What to Buy Instead

For every bad used car, there's a reliable alternative at a similar price:

- Instead of Nissan Altima → **Toyota Camry** or **Honda Accord**
- Instead of Jeep Cherokee → **Toyota RAV4** or **Mazda CX-5**
- Instead of Ford Escape 1.6T → **Honda CR-V** or **Subaru Forester**
- Instead of any luxury car in this list → **Lexus** (Toyota reliability, luxury experience)

## The Bottom Line

The cheapest car to buy is rarely the cheapest car to own. Avoid models with documented reliability problems, verify any vehicle's history before purchasing, and always get a professional inspection. Use [Car Lifespan Check](https://carlifespancheck.com) to research before you shop — it's free and takes just minutes.
