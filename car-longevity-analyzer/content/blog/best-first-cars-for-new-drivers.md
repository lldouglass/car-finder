# Best First Cars for New Drivers in 2026

A first car needs to do three things well: protect you in a crash, not break down, and not drain your bank account. New drivers are overrepresented in accident statistics (drivers aged 16-19 are nearly 3x more likely to be in a fatal crash than drivers 20+, per NHTSA data), so safety technology isn't a nice-to-have. It's the priority.

Here are the specific vehicles worth buying, with real safety data and ownership costs.

## The Best Picks

### 2017-2021 Honda Civic (10th Generation)

**Price Range:** $13,000-$18,000 at 40,000-80,000 miles
**Engine:** 2.0L K20C2 (base) or 1.5L L15B7 turbo
**Safety:** IIHS Top Safety Pick+ (2017-2021), 5-star NHTSA overall

The 10th-gen Civic earned IIHS Top Safety Pick+ every year of production. Honda Sensing comes standard on most trims starting in 2017, giving you automatic emergency braking, lane keeping assist, adaptive cruise control, and road departure mitigation.

**Which engine for a new driver:** Go with the 2.0L base engine. It makes 158 hp (plenty for a new driver), uses a traditional CVT, and has zero turbo-related maintenance concerns. The 1.5T is fine too, but the 2.0L is simpler and slightly cheaper to insure.

**NHTSA complaint count:** The 2017 Civic logged 902 complaints, but most were related to the 1.5T engine's oil dilution issue in cold climates (fuel mixing with oil during short trips). Honda issued a software update (TSB 18-025) and extended the warranty to 6 years on affected components. The 2.0L base engine has minimal complaints.

**Insurance cost for new drivers:** About $1,800-$2,400/year for a 19-year-old with clean record, depending on state and coverage level. That's below average for the compact car segment.

**Annual maintenance:** $350-$500

### 2020-2023 Toyota Corolla (E210)

**Price Range:** $15,000-$20,000 at 20,000-60,000 miles
**Engine:** 2.0L M20A-FKS Dynamic Force
**Safety:** IIHS Top Safety Pick (2020-2023), Toyota Safety Sense 2.0 standard on every trim

The 2020 redesign was a major step forward. Toyota Safety Sense 2.0 is standard on every single trim, including the base L. That means pre-collision with pedestrian detection, lane departure alert with steering assist, lane tracing assist, dynamic radar cruise control, and automatic high beams. For a new driver, this is a tremendous safety net.

**The 2.0L Dynamic Force engine** uses a combination of direct and port injection, which solves the carbon buildup problem that plagued earlier direct-injection-only engines. It's paired with a CVT (called "Direct Shift CVT") that simulates a traditional first gear before switching to belt drive. This makes acceleration from a stop feel more natural.

**NHTSA data:** The 2020 Corolla has just 388 total complaints across all categories. Most are minor (infotainment glitches, some wind noise). No pattern failures with the engine or transmission.

**Why it's great for new drivers:** Lowest insurance rates of any car on this list. The Corolla's combination of low theft rates, excellent crash test scores, and cheap repair costs make it an insurance company's dream.

**Annual maintenance:** $300-$400

### 2019-2022 Mazda3 (BP Generation)

**Price Range:** $16,000-$20,000 at 30,000-60,000 miles
**Engine:** 2.5L Skyactiv-G PE-VPS
**Safety:** IIHS Top Safety Pick+ (2020-2022), i-Activsense standard

The 4th-gen Mazda3 is the premium choice. The interior quality is genuinely closer to an Audi A3 than a Honda Civic, and i-Activsense safety tech (including blind-spot monitoring) is standard across all trims for 2019+. Blind-spot monitoring is particularly valuable for new drivers who haven't yet developed the habit of thorough mirror checks.

**The Skyactiv-G 2.5L** is naturally aspirated, uses port and direct injection, and makes 186 hp. No turbo complexity, no oil dilution, no carbon buildup. It's paired with a traditional 6-speed automatic (not a CVT), which is inherently more durable.

**Known issues:** NHTSA shows 385 complaints for the 2019 model year. The most common complaint is an infotainment screen defect (screen delamination or unresponsive touch). Mazda extended warranty to cover this. Mechanically, these are very clean.

**The catch:** Insurance rates are slightly higher than the Civic or Corolla because Mazda3 parts cost a bit more to replace in a collision. Expect $2,000-$2,800/year for a young driver.

**Annual maintenance:** $400-$550

### 2017-2022 Subaru Impreza

**Price Range:** $12,000-$18,000 at 40,000-90,000 miles
**Engine:** 2.0L FB20D boxer
**Safety:** IIHS Top Safety Pick+ (2017+), EyeSight standard on most trims

The Impreza is the only car in this price range with standard symmetrical all-wheel drive. For new drivers in states with real winters (Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado, New England), AWD provides a genuine safety margin on snow and ice. EyeSight driver assist (standard on Premium and above trims) includes adaptive cruise, pre-collision braking, and lane departure/sway warning.

**The FB20D engine** resolved the head gasket problems that plagued older Subaru EJ-series engines. It uses a timing chain (not belt), and NHTSA complaints for the 2017-2022 Impreza are relatively low (2018 model: 289 total complaints).

**Known problems:**
- Excessive oil consumption on some 2012-2016 FB20 engines (Subaru extended warranty coverage). The 2017+ models have fewer reports of this issue
- CVT (Lineartronic) is generally reliable but should have fluid changed every 60,000 miles despite Subaru's longer recommendation
- Windshield cracking from road debris is a common owner complaint (the glass seems thin)

**Annual maintenance:** $450-$600. AWD cars cost a bit more to maintain (tires must be replaced in sets of four, differential fluid changes).

### 2017-2021 Hyundai Elantra (AD Generation)

**Price Range:** $11,000-$16,000 at 40,000-80,000 miles
**Engine:** 2.0L Nu MPI
**Safety:** IIHS Top Safety Pick (2017-2020), SmartSense available

The Elantra is the budget pick. You get a lot of car for the money, and Hyundai's 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty (5 years/60,000 for second owner) provides real peace of mind.

**Stick with the 2.0L naturally aspirated engine.** Avoid the 1.4T and 1.6T options. The 2.0L Nu engine is simple, proven, and makes 147 hp. NHTSA complaint counts are reasonable: 502 for the 2017 model, dropping to 227 for the 2020.

**Known problems:**
- Some 2017-2018 models were included in Hyundai's massive engine recall (Campaign 20V-750) related to connecting rod bearing failure. Check recall status by VIN at nhtsa.gov/recalls before buying any Hyundai from this era
- Transmission (conventional 6-speed auto on the 2.0L) is reliable but can develop a slight shudder that a fluid change usually resolves

**Annual maintenance:** $400-$500

## Cars New Drivers Should Avoid

### Anything with More Than 250 HP

A Mustang GT, Camaro SS, or WRX STI as a first car is a bad idea backed by data. IIHS data shows that vehicles with higher power-to-weight ratios have higher fatal crash rates among young drivers. Insurance companies know this too, which is why a 19-year-old will pay $3,500-$5,000/year to insure a Mustang GT vs. $1,800-$2,400 for a Civic.

### Older German Luxury Cars

That $12,000 BMW 3-Series or Audi A4 will cost $2,000-$3,500/year in maintenance and repairs. New drivers don't need that financial stress on top of everything else.

### Any Nissan with a CVT (2013-2018)

The Sentra and Versa look cheap on paper. They're cheap because the Jatco CVT transmission fails regularly between 60,000-100,000 miles. Replacement costs $3,500-5,000. Run the VIN through NHTSA's complaint database and you'll see the pattern immediately.

### Full-Size Trucks and SUVs

Large vehicles are harder to maneuver in parking lots, have longer stopping distances, and have higher rollover risk. A new driver learning spatial awareness doesn't need the added challenge of a Ford F-150 or Chevy Tahoe.

## Safety Features Worth Paying For

Prioritize these in this order:

1. **Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB):** IIHS data shows AEB reduces rear-end crashes by 50%. This is the single most impactful safety feature for new drivers
2. **Blind-Spot Monitoring:** New drivers are terrible at checking blind spots. Electronic backup helps
3. **Lane Departure Warning/Assist:** Catches drifting from distraction or fatigue
4. **Backup Camera:** Mandatory on all cars sold after May 2018. If you're looking at anything older, make sure it has one or add one ($100-$200 aftermarket)

## Keeping Insurance Affordable

First-car insurance is expensive. These strategies actually work:

- **Choose a car with high IIHS/NHTSA ratings and low theft rates.** Insurance companies price based on claim history for each specific model
- **Stay on a parent's policy** if possible. Adding a young driver to an existing policy is significantly cheaper than a standalone policy
- **Take a state-approved defensive driving course.** Most insurers offer 5-10% discounts
- **Opt for higher deductibles** ($1,000 instead of $500) if you have savings to cover it. This can cut premiums 15-25%
