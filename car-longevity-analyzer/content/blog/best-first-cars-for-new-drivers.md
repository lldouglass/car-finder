## What Makes a Good First Car?

A first car needs to excel in three areas: safety, reliability, and affordability. New drivers are statistically more likely to be involved in accidents, so advanced safety features aren't optional — they're essential. Reliability matters because new drivers often can't afford unexpected repairs. And affordability covers not just the purchase price but insurance, fuel, and maintenance.

Here are the best options available in 2026, backed by safety ratings, reliability data, and real-world ownership costs.

## Cars New Drivers Should Avoid

### Sports Cars and Performance Vehicles
High horsepower and inexperience are a dangerous combination. Skip the Mustang, Camaro, WRX STI, and anything with over 250 HP for a first car. Insurance rates will also be astronomical.

### Older Luxury Cars (BMW, Mercedes, Audi)
They're temptingly cheap to buy but devastatingly expensive to repair. A $10,000 BMW can easily require $3,000+ in annual maintenance. New drivers don't need that financial stress.

### Full-Size Trucks and SUVs
Large vehicles are harder to maneuver, park, and control for inexperienced drivers. They also have higher rollover risk and consume significantly more fuel.

### Cars Without Modern Safety Features
Avoid anything without at least ABS, stability control, and multiple airbags. Ideally, look for automatic emergency braking and lane-departure warning. These features save lives, especially for new drivers.
