# How Long Does a Ford F-150 Last? Complete Reliability and Longevity Guide

The Ford F-150 has been America's best-selling vehicle for over 40 consecutive years. With that kind of volume, there's a massive dataset on what goes wrong, when it goes wrong, and which configurations to target. The short answer is that F-150s can last 200,000-300,000 miles, but the engine and model year you pick matters more than almost any other vehicle on the market.

## Expected Lifespan by Engine

This is the critical variable. An F-150 with the 5.0L V8 and a well-maintained F-150 with the 3.5L EcoBoost can have very different ownership experiences.

### 5.0L Coyote V8 (2011-Present): 250,000-350,000 Miles

The naturally aspirated 5.0L V8 is the longevity champion. No turbochargers to fail, no intercooler issues, no boost leaks. It's a straightforward, high-displacement engine that makes power without being stressed.

**Known issues:**
- **2011-2014:** Excessive oil consumption on some units, typically burning 1 quart every 2,000-3,000 miles. Ford attributed this to the Ti-VCT (variable cam timing) system and released updated cam phasers.
- **2018-2020:** Ticking/knocking noise at cold start, traced to cam phaser issues. Ford issued TSB 19-2346 and eventually extended the warranty on cam phasers to 10 years/150,000 miles for 2018-2020 models. Cam phaser replacement runs $2,000-$3,500 if out of warranty.

Despite these issues, the 5.0L remains the most durable F-150 engine. If you want maximum longevity and don't need the torque of the EcoBoost, this is the engine to buy.

### 3.5L EcoBoost V6 (2011-Present): 200,000-250,000 Miles

The twin-turbo 3.5L is the towing champion and makes impressive power (375-450 hp depending on year and tune). But turbochargers are additional failure points, and the EcoBoost has had its share of issues.

**Known issues:**
- **2011-2012:** Timing chain stretch, which can cause the engine to jump time and destroy itself. This was most common on engines that went too long between oil changes. Timing chain replacement runs $1,500-$2,500.
- **2013-2017:** Condensation buildup in the intercooler, causing misfire and stumble on hard acceleration in humid conditions. Ford released an updated intercooler drain for 2017+ and offered retrofits for earlier models.
- **2017-2020 (10-speed automatic):** Some owners reported harsh shifts and hunting between gears. Ford released multiple transmission software updates. Most 2019+ models have this sorted from the factory.
- **Carbon buildup:** As a direct-injected engine, the 3.5L EcoBoost develops carbon deposits on the intake valves. This is universal to GDI engines. A walnut blast cleaning every 80,000-100,000 miles ($400-$600) keeps things running smoothly.

### 2.7L EcoBoost V6 (2015-Present): 200,000-250,000 Miles

The smaller twin-turbo is lighter and more fuel-efficient. It's been a solid engine overall, with fewer complaints than the early 3.5L.

**Known issues:**
- **2015-2017:** Some reports of coolant intrusion into the cylinders on very early production 2.7L engines, potentially causing head gasket or block failure. This was uncommon but catastrophic ($4,000-$7,000 repair).
- **2018+:** Largely trouble-free. The second-generation 2.7L is a more refined engine with fewer reported issues. Annual maintenance costs are comparable to the 3.5L.

### 3.5L PowerBoost Hybrid (2021-Present): Too Early to Tell

Early data is promising. The hybrid system uses proven components from Ford's truck platform. The electric motor assists the turbo engine, reducing stress on both. Battery warranty is 10 years/150,000 miles. Limited complaints so far, but the oldest examples are only 4-5 years old.

### Engines to Avoid

**5.4L Triton V8 (2004-2010):** This is the F-150 engine with the worst reputation, and it's largely earned. The 3-valve version (2004-2010) has two notorious problems:
1. **Spark plug ejection** (2004-2008): The two-piece spark plugs seize in the aluminum heads. Removal often breaks the plug, requiring extraction ($500-$1,500 for all eight plugs). Use anti-seize and change plugs at 60,000-mile intervals, not 100,000.
2. **Cam phaser rattle:** Similar to the Coyote issue but more prevalent and more damaging. Replacement is $2,500-$4,000.

The 5.4L can last 200,000+ miles if maintained religiously, but it's the most expensive F-150 engine to keep running long-term.

## The Aluminum Body Question (2015+)

Ford switched to an aluminum body for 2015, and the internet lost its mind. "Aluminum dents easily!" "It'll corrode!" Seven years later, the data is clear: the aluminum body has been a net positive for longevity. It doesn't rust (a huge advantage over the steel-bodied 2004-2014 trucks), and repair costs for body damage, while initially higher, have normalized as shops gained experience.

The steel frame underneath is still the rust concern. If you're in a salt-belt state, undercoat the frame and inspect it annually.

## Transmission Reliability

- **6-speed automatic (6R80, 2011-2017):** Very reliable. These transmissions routinely go 200,000+ miles with regular fluid changes.
- **10-speed automatic (10R80, 2017+):** Had early software issues causing rough shifts. Ford has released multiple calibration updates, and the 2020+ versions are well-sorted. Change fluid every 60,000 miles; Ford says "lifetime fill," which is optimistic.

## Maintenance Costs: Budget Accordingly

F-150s are not cheap to maintain compared to a Civic or Corolla, but they're reasonable for a full-size truck:

- **Annual average maintenance:** $788 (per RepairPal)
- **Brake job (all four):** $400-$700
- **Ball joints (front):** $500-$900 per side
- **EcoBoost turbo replacement:** $1,200-$2,000 per turbo (they usually go one at a time)
- **Cam phaser replacement (5.0L):** $2,000-$3,500
- **Transmission fluid change (10-speed):** $250-$400
- **Spark plug replacement (5.0L):** $250-$400; (5.4L): $500-$1,500 due to extraction issues

## Best F-150 Configurations to Buy

**Best budget truck:** 2015-2017 F-150 with the 5.0L V8 and 6-speed automatic. First year of the aluminum body, proven engine, proven transmission. Prices have come down to $18,000-$25,000 for crew cab models with reasonable mileage.

**Best tow rig:** 2019+ F-150 with the 3.5L EcoBoost and Max Tow Package. By 2019, the 10-speed transmission software was refined, the intercooler condensation issue was fixed, and the 375 lb-ft of torque makes towing effortless.

**Best overall value:** 2018-2020 F-150 with the 5.0L V8. Check for cam phaser recall/warranty work completion. These trucks are hitting the depreciation sweet spot and the 5.0L in this generation produces 395 hp, which is more than adequate.

## Years and Configurations to Avoid

- **2004-2008 with 5.4L 3V:** Spark plug ejection and cam phaser issues make this the highest-risk F-150 configuration
- **2011-2012 with 3.5L EcoBoost:** First-year turbo engine; timing chain stretch concerns
- **2015 with 2.7L EcoBoost:** First year of this engine; coolant intrusion risk on early units
- **Any F-150 with the 6-cylinder 3.7L (2011-2014):** Not unreliable, but underpowered for a full-size truck. Low demand means poor resale value.

## How to Make Your F-150 Last 300,000 Miles

1. **Oil changes every 5,000-7,000 miles** with full synthetic. EcoBoost engines are especially sensitive to oil quality due to turbo bearing tolerances.
2. **Transmission fluid every 60,000 miles.** This is the single biggest factor in transmission longevity.
3. **Coolant every 100,000 miles** with Motorcraft Gold coolant.
4. **Spark plugs at 60,000 miles for the 5.4L, 100,000 for others.** Use anti-seize on the 5.4L.
5. **Walnut blast the intake valves every 80,000-100,000 miles** on EcoBoost engines.
6. **Inspect and lubricate ball joints and tie rod ends** annually if you tow or go off-road regularly.
7. **Undercoat the frame** if you live in the rust belt. Fluid Film or Krown annually is $150-$200 and can add years to the truck's life.

## The Bottom Line

The F-150 can be a 300,000-mile truck if you choose the right engine and maintain it properly. The 5.0L V8 is the durability king. The 3.5L EcoBoost is the performance/towing king with slightly higher maintenance requirements. The 5.4L Triton is the engine to avoid unless you're getting a significant discount and understand the maintenance requirements.

At the end of the day, the F-150's biggest longevity advantage is its ubiquity. Every mechanic in America knows how to work on one, parts are everywhere, and the aftermarket support is unmatched. That infrastructure alone adds years to a truck's useful life.
