## The Camry's Reputation: Is It Deserved?

The Toyota Camry has been America's best-selling sedan for over two decades. Its reputation for reliability is legendary — but is it actually backed by data, or is it just brand inertia?

We dug into NHTSA complaint records, long-term owner reports, and mechanical longevity data to give you a comprehensive reliability picture of every recent Camry generation.

**The short answer: Yes, the reputation is deserved.** The Camry consistently ranks among the most reliable vehicles ever made. But some years are better than others.

## Reliability by Generation

### 8th Generation (2018–2024) — Excellent

The current Camry rides on Toyota's TNGA platform, which brought significant improvements to ride quality and handling without sacrificing reliability. The 2.5L Dynamic Force engine is more efficient and more durable than its predecessor.

**Known issues:** Very few. Some early 2018 models had minor infotainment glitches. The 8-speed automatic transmission has been trouble-free.

**NHTSA complaint rate:** Significantly below average for the class.

**Expected lifespan:** 250,000–350,000 miles with proper maintenance.

### 7th Generation (2012–2017) — Very Good

A solid generation that improved on the somewhat bland 6th gen. The 2.5L 2AR-FE engine is one of Toyota's most reliable four-cylinders ever. The 6-speed automatic is proven and durable.

**Known issues:** The 2012 model year had slightly higher complaint rates (typical of first-year models). Some owners reported excessive oil consumption in 2012–2014 models, but Toyota addressed this with updated piston rings.

**NHTSA complaint rate:** Below average, especially 2015–2017 models.

**Expected lifespan:** 250,000–300,000 miles.

### 6th Generation (2007–2011) — Good (With Caveats)

This generation had a rougher start. The 2007–2009 models had notably higher complaint rates, particularly around excessive oil consumption in the 2.4L 2AZ-FE engine. Toyota eventually acknowledged the issue and offered extended warranty coverage.

**Known issues:** 2AZ-FE oil consumption, dashboard cracking, power steering issues in 2007 models.

**NHTSA complaint rate:** Above average for 2007–2009, below average for 2010–2011.

**Best years to buy:** 2010 or 2011, which benefited from mid-cycle fixes.

**Expected lifespan:** 200,000–280,000 miles.

### 5th Generation (2002–2006) — Very Good

A sweet spot for used Camry buyers. These cars are old enough to be very affordable but reliable enough to have years of life left. The 2.4L and 3.3L V6 engines are both excellent.

**Known issues:** Minor oil sludge concerns with the 2.4L if oil changes were neglected. The V6 models are essentially bulletproof.

**Expected lifespan:** 250,000–300,000 miles (many are still on the road today).

## Camry Maintenance Costs

One reason the Camry is so popular is its low maintenance costs:

- **Annual maintenance cost:** $350–$500 (well below the $650 industry average)
- **Major services (timing, fluids, brakes):** $150–$400 each
- **Parts availability:** Excellent — aftermarket parts are cheap and abundant
- **Labor time:** Most repairs are straightforward, keeping labor costs down

The Camry's simplicity is a feature. Toyota doesn't use exotic materials or complex systems when simpler solutions work just as well.

## Camry vs. The Competition

### Camry vs. Honda Accord

Both are excellent. The Accord offers a sportier driving experience, while the Camry prioritizes comfort and lower maintenance costs. Reliability is nearly identical. It's a personal preference choice.

### Camry vs. Hyundai Sonata

The Sonata offers more features for less money, but the Camry's long-term reliability is better documented. If you plan to keep the car 10+ years, the Camry is the safer bet.

### Camry vs. Nissan Altima

Not a close competition. The Camry's conventional automatic transmission is far more reliable than the Altima's CVT. The Camry wins on reliability, resale value, and longevity.

## What to Look For When Buying a Used Camry

Even the reliable Camry has things to watch for:

- **2007–2009 models:** Check oil consumption (run the engine and watch for smoke)
- **All years:** Verify the timing belt/chain was serviced on schedule
- **High-mileage examples:** Check for transmission fluid condition and smooth shifting
- **Hybrid models:** Battery health is a concern after 150,000 miles (replacement costs $2,000–$3,000)

## The Best Years to Buy

If you're shopping for a used Camry, these are the sweet spots:

- **Budget pick:** 2015–2017 (7th gen, all issues resolved, under $18,000)
- **Best value:** 2019–2020 (8th gen TNGA platform, modern features, $18,000–$24,000)
- **Best overall:** 2021–2023 (latest updates, excellent reliability, $22,000–$28,000)

## The Bottom Line

The Toyota Camry deserves its reputation as one of the most reliable cars ever made. It's not the most exciting car on the road, but it is one of the smartest purchases you can make. Low maintenance costs, excellent resale value, and a proven track record of lasting 250,000+ miles make it the benchmark for reliability.
