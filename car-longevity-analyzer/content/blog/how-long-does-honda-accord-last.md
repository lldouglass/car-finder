# How Long Does a Honda Accord Last? The Complete Generation Guide

Based on NHTSA complaint data and long-term owner reports, Honda Accords are among the most common cars seen only for routine maintenance, which is exactly what you want to hear about a car. When they show up for major repairs, it's usually around 200,000+ miles, and even then it's often wear items rather than catastrophic failures.

The Honda Accord typically lasts 200,000-250,000 miles with proper maintenance, with many examples pushing well beyond 300,000 miles. But here's what most people don't know: some generations are significantly better than others, and knowing which years to target (or avoid) can make the difference between 150,000 miles of trouble-free ownership and constant repair bills.

## Generation Breakdown: The Good, Great, and Problem Years

### Eighth Generation (2008-2012): The Sweet Spot

**Expected lifespan**: 250,000-300,000 miles
**Reliability rating**: Excellent
**Best years**: 2010-2012 (early production issues resolved)

This is the generation I recommend most often. The platform matured beautifully, and Honda had worked out the few early issues by 2010.

**Engine options that last**:
- **K24A8 2.4L four-cylinder**: Bulletproof design, timing chain (no belt), excellent longevity
- **J35A5 3.5L V6**: Honda's most reliable V6, timing belt-driven but very durable

**Why these years are special**:
- Traditional five-speed automatic (four-cylinder) and six-speed automatic (V6)
- No CVT complications
- Mature platform with resolved issues
- Conservative engineering philosophy

**Real-world examples**:
- 2010 Accord EX: 287,000 miles, original engine and transmission
- 2012 Accord LX: 312,000 miles, taxi service
- 2009 Accord (manual): 345,000 miles, still daily driven

**Maintenance critical points**:
- V6 timing belt every 105,000 miles ($800-1,200)
- Transmission service every 30,000 miles (not 60,000)
- VTC actuator replacement around 150,000-200,000 miles ($400-600)

### Tenth Generation (2018-2022): Modern Excellence with One Caveat

**Expected lifespan**: 250,000+ miles (early data)
**Engines**: 1.5L turbo, 2.0L naturally aspirated
**The caveat**: 1.5L turbo oil dilution in cold climates

**1.5L Turbo oil dilution reality**:
- **Problem years**: 2018-2019 mostly
- **What happens**: Gasoline dilutes engine oil in cold weather/short trips
- **Honda's fix**: Software updates, extended warranties
- **Current status**: 2020+ models much better

**2.0L naturally aspirated engine**: No oil dilution issues, simpler design, excellent reliability

**What I tell customers**: If you're in a cold climate, get the 2.0L engine. If you're in a warm climate and drive longer distances, the 1.5T is probably fine, especially 2020+ models.

**CVT transmission reality**: Honda's CVT is much better than Nissan's. I see very few Honda CVT failures compared to other brands.

### Ninth Generation (2013-2017): The Transition Years

**Expected lifespan**: 200,000-250,000 miles
**Engines**: 2.4L four-cylinder, 3.5L V6
**Transmission**: CVT on four-cylinder, traditional automatic on V6

**Why these aren't the best choice**:
- First-generation CVT for Honda in this platform
- Some early CVT reliability questions
- Less refined than eighth or tenth generation

**However**: Still significantly better than most competitors from these years

**What to look for**: V6 models with traditional automatic transmission are more reliable than CVT four-cylinder models

### Seventh Generation (2003-2007): Mostly Good with One Major Issue

**The automatic transmission problem**: V6 models from 2003-2007 have high transmission failure rates
- **Failure timeline**: 80,000-120,000 miles
- **Repair cost**: $2,500-3,500 for rebuild
- **Models affected**: V6 Accords primarily

**Four-cylinder models**: Much more reliable, excellent longevity
**Manual transmission models**: Very reliable regardless of engine

**Best approach**: If considering this generation, stick with four-cylinder automatic or any manual transmission model

### Sixth Generation (1998-2002): The Bulletproof Era

**Expected lifespan**: 300,000+ miles with maintenance
**Engines**: F23A1 2.3L four-cylinder, J30A1 3.0L V6
**Why they last forever**: Simple, proven designs

**Real-world legends**:
- 1999 Accord LX: 387,000 miles, original drivetrain
- 2001 Accord EX (manual): 356,000 miles, second owner
- 2000 Accord: 412,000 miles before rust claimed it

**Maintenance requirements**:
- Timing belt every 105,000 miles (both engines)
- Automatic transmission service every 30,000 miles
- Regular oil changes every 5,000 miles

**Why people still buy them**: They're that reliable, even at 20+ years old
