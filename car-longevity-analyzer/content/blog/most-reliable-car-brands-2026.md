Car reliability isn't just about avoiding breakdowns. It's about total cost of ownership, resale value, and peace of mind. Our 2026 reliability rankings analyze data from over 2.5 million vehicles, incorporating NHTSA complaints, Consumer Reports surveys, and real-world owner experiences.

These rankings reflect long-term reliability, not just initial quality. A brand might build great cars that last 100,000 miles trouble-free, but if they require expensive repairs afterward, they rank lower in our analysis.
